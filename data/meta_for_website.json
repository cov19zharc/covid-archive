Prior to this, due to the lack of economy of the Soviet regime emphasized that \"self-sacrifice\", also retained some Soviet people's subjective motivation; after 1932, with the \"self-sacrifice\" to \"be grateful\", the Soviets down into an additional mandatory spirit among the subjective motivation they disappeared.

Recently, for the applicable legal issues encountered in handling the case, research director Jiang Qibo Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate Heights High Legal Policy Research Office, reporters interviewed. First, ask: When handling criminal cases involving obstruction of epidemic prevention and control, how to accurately apply to the crime of endangering public safety and crime of obstruction of infectious disease control? A: The \"two high\", Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Justice \"on the law punishing obstruction of novel coronavirus infection pneumonia epidemic prevention and control of crimes\" (hereinafter referred to as \"Opinion\") provides that: \"the deliberate spread of novel coronavirus infection pathogens pneumonia, of the following circumstances, endanger public safety, in accordance with Article 114, the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 115, the crime of endangering public safety be convicted and punished: 1 has been confirmed novel coronavirus infection in patients with pneumonia, pathogen carriers refuse treatment in isolation or quarantine has less than break away from isolation and treatment, and access to public places or public transport; 2. novel coronavirus infection in patients with suspected pneumonia refuse treatment in isolation or quarantine period not at full break away from isolation and treatment, and access to public places or public transport, resulting in the spread of the novel coronavirus. \"Under this provision, in handling criminal cases involving obstruction of epidemic prevention and control measures applicable to the crime of endangering public safety, should pay attention to the following three aspects: First, be limited to the main body of the new crown pneumonia patients have been diagnosed, pathogen carriers or new crown pneumonia suspected patient; the second is having deliberately spread the new crown pathogens pneumonia subjective; Third, the performance objective for the refuse treatment in isolation or quarantine has less than break away from isolation and treatment, an act into public places or public transport, which crown the new suspected cases of pneumonia also requires consequences novel coronavirus transmission. In practice, applicable to the crime of endangering public safety should be strictly grasp the law. For both cases the provisions of the \"views\", shall apply to the crime of endangering public safety. In addition, knowing itself already diagnosed patients new crown pneumonia or suspected patients, out of revenge society subjective intent, malicious spread of the virus to an unspecified number of people, the consequences are serious, adverse circumstances, it should also be applied in a dangerous way crimes against public security. For other refused to carry epidemic prevention and control measures, the new coronavirus causes the spread or a serious danger of spreading behavior, in accordance with the provisions of Article 130 of the Penal Code for the crime of obstruction of infectious disease prevention and control. Second, ask: At present, the epidemic prevention and control measures against obstruction caused by negligent behavior of the spread of infectious diseases, in some places negligence in a dangerous way crimes against public security filing, in some places to the crime of obstruction of infectious disease prevention and control on file, how the judiciary should be accurate applicable charges? A: In 2003, \"two high\" \"interpretation on issues of handling nuisance prevention and control of infectious diseases such as sudden disasters criminal cases, the specific application of the law\" does not prejudice the provisions applicable to the crime prevention and control of infectious diseases, but with provisions for conflict infectious diseases or suspected outbreaks of infectious diseases and refused to accept the quarantine, compulsory quarantine or treatment, negligence spread of infectious diseases, in serious cases, endanger public safety, endangering public safety, convicted and punished in accordance with negligence. This is mainly because in 2003 the former Ministry of Health, the \"atypical pneumonia\" included in the statutory infectious diseases, but not explicitly for the Class A Class infectious diseases or in accordance with the management, resulting in barriers sin applicable prejudice infectious disease control. The epidemic prevention and control work, the national health health committee approved by the State Council issued Notice No. 1 of 2020, has been explicitly incorporated into the novel coronavirus infection pneumonia B infectious diseases specified in \"Infectious Diseases Prevention Law,\" and take the CPI infection disease prevention and control measures. In order to fully reflect the requirements of the prevention and control of law, the \"opinions\" issued for such refusal to implement preventive health and epidemic prevention institutions submitted in accordance with the provisions of Communicable Disease Prevention Act, control measures, resulting in the behavior of the new crown spread of pneumonia, infectious disease prevention and control shall apply prejudice crime. It is further noted that the crime of endangering public health nuisance prevention and control of infectious diseases, actually a kind of acts that endanger public safety, with negligence in a dangerous way crimes against public security, is actually a relationship Lapping of Legal Provisions should be in accordance with the special law superior to the general principles applicable law, the crime of obstruction of infectious disease prevention and control prevail. Third, ask: how to identify \"new crown patients already diagnosed with pneumonia\" and \"pneumonia suspected cases of the new crown\"? The behavior of people do not know their own situation at that time, after being identified as a new crown pneumonia patients or suspected patients, whether or not can be identified? A: According to Article 78 of the \"Infectious Diseases Prevention Law,\" infectious disease patients or suspected patients of infectious diseases that means the health administrative departments of the State Council issued the \"diagnostic criteria for Infectious Disease Prevention Act regulations governing\" and in line with infection disease patients and suspected patients of infectious disease diagnostic criteria person.

Why \"rumor\" information will definitely more than \"rumors\" information is more credible? In the current semantic network, the \"rumors\" false information, \"rumor\" is a rebuttal to the \"rumors\" by some authority, to clarify. There is also a gray area between the two, that is unconfirmed, I do not know the true and false information. In academic circles, the rumors and there is no single definition. But worthy of reflection is whether the rumors must be equated with ulterior motives to distort reality in today's context, fabricating and spreading remarks? Or may be in the institutional channels fail a society spontaneously generated by the pursuit of truth collective action aimed at? Hu Yong in his paper summarizes some of the academic representative has defined rumors, its definition has several things in common last century - widely circulated unconfirmed. 1. Rumors is a reference to current events, designed to make people believe that proposition, without the official confirmed the widespread (Knapp, 1944). 2. Rumors is a proposition associated with the current events, intended to make people believe, generally by way of word of mouth spread from person to person, but the lack of reliable evidence standard (Allport & Postman, 1947). 3. Is a rumor spread from person to person, public concern about things, events or issues unproven or narrative interpretation (Peterson & Gist, 1951). 4. Rumors impromptu news (Shibutani, 1966) resulting in a group of people talking about the process. 5. The rumor was spread information about the current events in social groups, entirely by word of mouth, often without any basis in fact (Morin, 1969). 6. It is an unproven rumor, widespread proposition (Rosnow & Fine, 1976). 7. Rumors appeared in society and spread without official publicly confirmed or has been rumor of official information (Kapufeilei, 1990). (Quote from Hu Yong papers) Allport and Postman has proposed a widely accepted formula, namely: the ambiguity of rumors = (question) the importance × (facts). Multiplication formula means that, if the importance of the event-related rumors zero, or zero ambiguity of the event, there is no space to generate and spread rumors. And when the importance of strong, ambiguity is also strong, the rumors will produce a large number of widely disseminated. Shibuya sociologist Paul believes in his study, when the information can provide institutional channels can not meet the demand for news, rumors will produce. The greater the extent of this unmet, the more rumors will proliferate. Similarly, Hu Yong in its \"rumor, as a social protest,\" a paper, also raised: If a social order, the information is tightly controlled by the authorities, the rumors will be very intense.

March, 2020.\n\n    Aurthor｜龚菁琦 Guon JinQi ; Editor｜金石 Jin Shi ; Photograhy｜尹夕远 Yen XiYuan\n\nIt was 5am on March 1st when I received the text from Ai Fen, the Director of the Emergency Department (ER) of Wuhan Central Hospital, who agreed to the interview. Approximately half an hour later, 5:32 am, her peer Jiang Xueqing, the Director of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, passed away from the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19. Two days later, the deputy director of Ophthalmology of the hospital, Mei Zhongming, passed away. Mei and Li Wenliang were in the same department.\n\n(Dr. Li Wenliang was one of the eight whistleblowers of coronavirus who died on February 7th, 2020. Dr. Jian Xueqing has worked in the Wuhan Central Hospital for thirty years. He was known as the warm doctor with a soft voice).\n\nAs of March 9th, 2020, four medical staff from the Wuhan Central Hospital have passed away from COVID-19. Since the outbreak, this hospital, just a few kilometers away from the Huanan Seafood Market, has become one of the most infected hospitals in Wuhan City. According to media reports, more than 200 people in Wuhan Central hospital were infected, including three vice presidents and multiple functional department directors. Moreover, several sectional directors are currently using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain their health.\n\nWuhan Central Hospital, the largest grade A hospital (first class hospital) in central Wuhan is overshadowed by death. A doctor told 人物 (Renwu or People), almost no one spoke in the hospital, but all mourned and discussed in private.\n\nThe tragedy of the coronavirus had a chance to be avoided. On December 30th, 2019, Ai Fen received a virus detection report regarding a patient with unknown pneumonia. She circled the words “SARS coronavirus” in red. When Ai Fen was asked by one of her university peers, she took a photo of this report and sent it to this fellow doctor. The same night, this report was shared throughout the entire circle of doctors in Wuhan. Those who forwarded the reports include the eight doctors who were investigated by the police for “spreading rumours.”\n\nAi Fen was identified as the original author of the report and was unprecedentedly and sharply reprimanded by the hospital disciplinary committee for spreading rumours as a professional.\n\nIn the afternoon of March 2nd, Ai Fen agreed to have an interview with People in the Nanjing Road District of Wuhan Central Hospital. She sat in the emergency room office alone. The emergency department, which used to admit more than 1,500 patients a day, is now quiet. Only one homeless person lied there in the emergency hall.\n\nAccording to some previous news reports, Ai Fen, when she surfaced, was described as “another female doctor who has been warned”. Some people called her a whistleblower, but Ai Fen has corrected this statement— she is not a whistleblower, but the person who handed out the whistle. During the interview with People, Ai Fen mentioned the word “regret” multiple times. She regretted not being able to continue blowing the whistle after the “disciplinary discussion”, especially towards her peers who had passed away. “Had I known what would happen today, I would not care about all the reprimands and criticisms, and would speak up about it everywhere, right?”\n\nWhat have Ai Fen and the Wuhan Central Hospital experienced in the past two months? Below is Ai Fen’s narrative.\n\nThe unprecedented rebuke (This is a translation of Ai Fen recounting the story in her own words)\n\nOn December 16, 2020, our Emergency Department at the Nanjing Road Branch of Wuhan Central Hospital admitted a patient. The patient had an unexplainable high fever, The medication didn’t work and the body temperature didn’t come down. On December 22nd, the patient was transferred to the respiratory department and a bronchoscopy was performed, so that his/her alveolar lavage fluid could be acquired. The sample was sent to an external institution for high-throughput sequencing. Later, the result was informed orally, stating that it is coronavirus. At that time, a colleague who managed the hospital beds whispered several times in my ear: “Director Ai, that person is reported to be infected with coronavirus”. It was only afterwards that we found out the patient had worked in the Huanan Seafood Market (The first accused community-infected location).\n\nOn December 27th, another patient arrived at our Nanjing Road Branch. The patient was the nephew of a doctor in our department. He was in his 40s. He did not have any preexisting illness; however, his lungs were messed up and his blood oxygen saturation value was only 90% (A healthy individual should be above 94%). The hospital treated him for almost 10 days without any improvement, and the patient was transferred to the respiratory department. He also received a bronchoscopy, and his alveolar lavage fluid was sent out for testing.\n\nAt noon on December 30th, my classmate at Tongji Hospital sent me a screenshot through WeChat, which said: “Don’t go to the Huanan Seafood Market, many people came out with high fever …”. He asked me if this message was true. At the time, I was looking at the CT scan of a patient with typical pulmonary infection. I sent my classmate an 11-seconds video recorded from the CT scan and told him that this came from a patient who was admitted to our emergency room this morning. He also came from the Huanan Seafood Market.\n\nJust after 4 pm on December 30th, my colleague showed me a report that stated: SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 kinds of oral / respiratory colonization bacteria. I carefully and repeatedly read the report. One of the footnotes states: “SARS coronavirus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The main transmission modes of the virus are short-range airborne transmission of expiratory droplets or indirect contact with expiratory droplets of infected patients. This is a special pneumonia that can be significantly contagious and can affect multiple organ systems. This is also known as atypical pneumonia”.\n\nAt that time, I broke out in a cold sweat. This is a terrifying thing. Normally, when a patient is admitted to the respiratory care unit, the respiratory department should report this case. However, to play it safe, I immediately called and reported the situation to the hospital’s public health department and the infectious disease department. At that time, the director of our respiratory department happened to pass by my door. He was once involved in the SARS crisis. I grabbed him and said: “We have a patient who was admitted to your department and we found out that he is infected with coronavirus”. He glanced and immediately said: “This is troublesome. I knew this would be very concerning”.\n\nAfter calling the departments of the hospital, I also circulated this report to one of my classmates. I purposely circled the sentence “SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 types of oral/respiratory colonization bacteria” in red, to catch his attention. I also circulated the report in the doctor’s group chat to alert everyone to take precautions.\n\nOn the night of 30th December, the message was spread widely. The screenshot of the report with the red circle was everywhere. I found out later that the message doctor Li Wenliang (the famous whistleblower) passed around is the same screenshot. At that time, I smelled trouble. Around 10:20 pm, the hospital sent me a message, a notice from the city health committee. Essentially, it asked us to stop arbitrarily releasing information relating to the unknown pneumonia to avoid public panic. If panic is caused due to this information leakage, one should be held responsible.\n\nI was very scared at the time. I immediately forwarded the message to my classmate. About an hour later, the hospital sent another notice, emphasizing again that this internal pneumonia-related information should not be shared publicly. One day later, at 11:46 pm on 1st of January, 2020, the head of the hospital disciplinary committee sent me a message. He asked me to visit the committee the next morning.\n\nI couldn’t sleep that entire night. I was very worried and thought about this over and over again; yet I felt that there are always two sides to everything. Even if it caused adversity, it is not necessarily a bad thing to alert the medical staff in Wuhan to take precautions. Around eight o’clock the next morning, before I finished my shift, I was called immediately to the office.\n\nIn the meeting, I was subjected to an unprecedented and severe rebuke. The leader said: “We couldn’t raise our heads when we go out for meetings. You were directly criticized by another director. As the director of the emergency department of the Wuhan Central Hospital, you are a professional. How can you not have any principles and be so undisciplined to spread rumours?” These are his exact words. He wanted me to communicate verbally, either through face to face meeting or call one by one, to all 200+people in the department that we are not allowed to spread this pneumonia information via WeChat or SMS, “not even to our husbands”.\n\n\n", "English title": "The person who handed out the whistle — the warning of coronavirus (COVID-19)", "Archive URL": "https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nEy0jq5wjj-g6DQVZep1Wg", "Keywords": "李文亮,Li Wenliang,艾芬Ai Fen,武漢Wuhan,吹哨者,whistleblower", "Text in English": "Y"}, {"Original Url": "https://m.jiemian.com/article/4139295.html", "slug": "896", "Information Type": "news and articles", "Published on": "2020-03-19", "原文標題": "《新英格兰医学杂志》：抗艾滋药物未能缩短新冠患者病情改善时间", "Medium/Platform": "Jiemian.com", "English content": "March 19, Beijing Sino-Japanese cooperation by the Hospital and Hospital of Wuhan Jinyintan together to complete the first global randomized controlled clinical trials of new crown pneumonia COVID-19 online published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" (NEJM).
