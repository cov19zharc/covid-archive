"Original    \nWritten by Hou Siyin and   Yang Zhijie  \nChina News Weekly\n\nFor patients with end-stage cancer, the consequence of \"temporary expropriation\" is forced discharge, no medicine, no infusion, and only going home\nLiu Jun's (pseudonym) relative is a patient with end-stage gastric cancer, who was receiving hospice care in Wuhan Guangfa Cancer Hospital.\nAt 7: 50 pm on February 5, they suddenly received a notice that the hospital was temporarily requisitioned, and all the wards were used to accept and treat patients with fever suspected of COVID-19.\nLiu Jun's relative and at least 15 other patients with end-stage cancer were all required to be discharged from hospital.\n10 minutes later, the patient was stopped and given half of the nutrient solution, and was carried out from the hospital.\n3 days later, the medical team of Zhoukou City, Henan Province took over the secondary specialized hospital.\nAs a matter of fact, this hospital is not among the five designated hospitals with COVID-19 announced by Wuhan, and it was also stated as \"temporary requisition\" in official news reports.\nHowever, for patients with end-stage cancer, the consequence of \"temporary expropriation\" is forced discharge, no medicine, no infusion, and only going home\nMiao Xiaohui, a Shanghai public health clinical consultant, told China News Weekly that some hospitals are understaffed, doctors were afraid, and patients were afraid to go to hospitals.\nHowever, it is an urgent problem for patients with chronic diseases and malignant tumors such as diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease to receive reexamination and effective treatment. The government should consider how to make these patients see doctor.\nWith the development of the epidemic situation, he was worried that patients with chronic diseases will face greater difficulties.\nThe following is Liu Jun's dictation.\nIn this extraordinary period, the appeal to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic was overwhelming, while the calls of these ordinary chronic patients and their families are rarely heard:\nMy relative is 59 years old and suffers from end-stage gastric cancer. The whole stomach was removed 4 years ago and relapsed at the end of last year.\nShe also has severe intestinal obstruction, because after gastrectomy, she could only eat by intestinal tract, so after intestinal obstruction, her body began to deteriorate obviously. In December last year, she couldn't swallow anything, and once she ate it, she would spit it out.\nAfter many attempts, the doctor felt that chemotherapy had no effect on her, and other treatments were unnecessary.\nBut she couldn't eat, and we couldn't be taken care at home, so after many inquiries, they found Wuhan Guangfa Cancer Hospital.\nThis is a second-class oncology hospital, and it is also the designated hospital for severe cancer outpatient service in Wuhan. It mainly treats some patients with severe cancer and provides special hospice care services.\nBecause normal hospitals generally dissuaded such patients who did not need further treatment, we searched around and found that this hospital was in good condition at that time, and every patient was in a single room, so we sent her to hospital on January 17.\nWuhan was locked down on January 23, which didn't have much impact on us at the beginning. Because this hospital is specialized in oncology, no new patients were accepted after the lockdown, leaving only critically ill patients.\nThe whole hospital was basically in a semi-lockdown state, and all the entrances and exits were controlled, so that only family members can enter, and we wore masks every time.\nOn February 2, we suddenly received a notice from the hospital that the hospital might be requisitioned to receive fever patients, and the whole building where we are located would be vacated, and all the original patients would be moved to another new building.\nSo from this day on, all the medical personnel and patients began to do the work of ward transfer, and the medical personnel worked very hard and did not rest for 24 hours.\nAt about 6 o'clock on the evening of February 5, we went to deliver things, and the doctor ran out in a hurry, saying that they had just received the notice and would move soon, and all the patients with fever would have to live in within 2 or 3 hours.\nThen all the patients' families were called to the hospital urgently. Like other families, we began to move things to the new ward of another building.\nAfter arriving at the new ward, the head nurse answered a phone call less than 5 minutes after cleaning the room. She collapsed at that time, saying that the superior had received a notice asking all our patients to leave the hospital immediately and go home, and the whole hospital was requisitioned. It was around 7: 50 pm.\nIt was chaotic at that time, and many patients had not moved well.\nThere were about 15 patients receiving hospice care like my relatives, all of whom were middle-aged and elderly people.\nWhen receiving the notice, everyone was shocked, and many people were scared. They didn't know when the fever patients would come, because the notice said they would come soon.\nOur first reaction at that time was what to do next.\nThese patients are all hospice patients, and there was no other treatment. They just had nutrient solution every day to maintain their basic survival, and they couldn't get rice and water.\nTherefore, after leaving the hospital, as long as I stop infusion, they had no means to treat themselves, and they could only die when going back home.\nAt that time, many patients, including us, raised the question of follow-up treatment. However, there was no oral explanation on how to treat the patients, how to care at home and how to relieve their pain.\nI asked if at least some medicines could be provided, but it couldn’t.\n\nI could see that the doctors and nurses really wanted to help, but they really couldn't help it, and they were devastated because they didn't have any psychological preparation or protective facilities for patients who will receive fever.\nAs a specialized hospital, I have never received fever patients before.\nAfter the epidemic situation in Wuhan became serious, these medical personnel only wore masks. When they moved to the ward, only a few personnel wore protective clothing, but they were rather simple and crude.\nLater, we were the first to decide to leave. At that time, before the nutrient solution was finished, the infusion stopped on the spot and the patient was carried away. It was 8 o'clock in the evening when we left the hospital.\nBecause we didn't want the old man to toss about, and we didn't want to make a noise in front of her.\nAt that time, some medical personnel told us that the hospital would be completely closed soon. If we didn't leave now, no one could leave when the fever patient came.\nWhen we left, other patients were still negotiating with the hospital. As far as I know, these people were forced to move out later.\nI learned that the whole cancer hospital was taken over by a medical team in Zhoukou City, Henan Province, so I wanted to contact the doctors and nurses before, but I couldn't get in touch.\nI read the news report and found that Zhoukou Medical Team entered Wuhan Guangfa Cancer Hospital on the morning of February 8, that is, the 3rd day after we were forced to leave the hospital.\nAfter being forced to leave the hospital, I began to find a way.\nFirst, I found out from my friends in Wuhan Union Hospital that all the wards in Union Hospital were full, and now their medical personnel were limited, so there were not many patients like us who need treatment.\nLater, I went to the People's Liberation Army No.161 Hospital, and they said that for any patient in hospitals in Wuhan, it was necessary to first rule out the suspected patients with COVID-19, such as taking chest radiographs, taking blood to see white blood cells, and whether there were fever symptoms, etc., and then they could accept them after exclusion, only if they have beds.\nThe oncology department of No.161 Hospital has been shut down, and there was no available bed, so they couldn’t be accepted.\nA few days ago, I contacted Caidian district People's Hospital, and the other party said they could accept it, but they also had fever patients there, so we could be hospitalized if we wanted to.\nBecause Caidian Hospital is outside the lockdown Wuhan, we haven't had the road pass, so we couldn’t go there.\nThe person who locked the road told us to go to the community office to solve this problem.\nI also contacted 2 private hospitals, which provided hospice care services, but they all said that although they had beds, they no longer accepted new patients.\nLater, I learned through some friends that it was common in Wuhan that patients with end-stage cancer have no way to seek treatment.\nMy friend's family was in Hebei, and had died in a similar situation.\nIf hospitalization didn’t work, we wondered if we can get some nutrient solution by ourselves or find a doctor to inject it at home.\nHowever, it was later discovered that drugs such as nutrient solution, tranquilization, anesthesia and pain relief were all controlled drugs in hospitals, which could only be prescribed by doctors after hospitalization.\nNow, even if such drugs can be prescribed, it was very difficult for nurses to give injections when they could not be hospitalized.\nBecause of several medical disputes, Wuhan stopped all the \"home care\" services in 2019. Doctors were forbidden to go to residents' homes without permission in major hospitals, including nurses' nursing.\nBut now, after all, it was a special case. I hoped the hospital can find a more feasible plan considering our patients.\nAfter my relatives came home, they left the nutrient solution, and became weaker. There were new inflammations in the body and no anti-inflammatory drugs. The patients became more and more painful, and they kept crying for pain, moaning all the time, and their sanity gradually began to become unconscious, only instinctive reaction, shouting for pain or losing their temper.\nNow, the frequency and times of her screaming has become less and less, because she was getting weaker and weaker.\nFrom the evening of February 5 to now, she has not eaten at all and has not slept at all.\nWe looked very worried and uncomfortable.\nIf there was any way to relieve the pain of our loved ones even for a day or a half, we would feel a little comfort in our hearts.\nBut whatever, we wouldn’t give up.\n(On February 13, shortly after Liu Jun was interviewed by China News Weekly, the reporter learned that his family had passed away.\nIn his reply, he said: I sincerely hope that your report can help more families and people! )\n(This article exclusively contributes to Tencent platform, which cannot be reproduced without authorization)\nEditor on duty:

March, 2020.\n\n    Aurthor｜龚菁琦 Guon JinQi ; Editor｜金石 Jin Shi ; Photograhy｜尹夕远 Yen XiYuan\n\nIt was 5am on March 1st when I received the text from Ai Fen, the Director of the Emergency Department (ER) of Wuhan Central Hospital, who agreed to the interview. Approximately half an hour later, 5:32 am, her peer Jiang Xueqing, the Director of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, passed away from the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19. Two days later, the deputy director of Ophthalmology of the hospital, Mei Zhongming, passed away. Mei and Li Wenliang were in the same department.\n\n(Dr. Li Wenliang was one of the eight whistleblowers of coronavirus who died on February 7th, 2020. Dr. Jian Xueqing has worked in the Wuhan Central Hospital for thirty years. He was known as the warm doctor with a soft voice).\n\nAs of March 9th, 2020, four medical staff from the Wuhan Central Hospital have passed away from COVID-19. Since the outbreak, this hospital, just a few kilometers away from the Huanan Seafood Market, has become one of the most infected hospitals in Wuhan City. According to media reports, more than 200 people in Wuhan Central hospital were infected, including three vice presidents and multiple functional department directors. Moreover, several sectional directors are currently using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain their health.\n\nWuhan Central Hospital, the largest grade A hospital (first class hospital) in central Wuhan is overshadowed by death. A doctor told 人物 (Renwu or People), almost no one spoke in the hospital, but all mourned and discussed in private.\n\nThe tragedy of the coronavirus had a chance to be avoided. On December 30th, 2019, Ai Fen received a virus detection report regarding a patient with unknown pneumonia. She circled the words “SARS coronavirus” in red. When Ai Fen was asked by one of her university peers, she took a photo of this report and sent it to this fellow doctor. The same night, this report was shared throughout the entire circle of doctors in Wuhan. Those who forwarded the reports include the eight doctors who were investigated by the police for “spreading rumours.”\n\nAi Fen was identified as the original author of the report and was unprecedentedly and sharply reprimanded by the hospital disciplinary committee for spreading rumours as a professional.\n\nIn the afternoon of March 2nd, Ai Fen agreed to have an interview with People in the Nanjing Road District of Wuhan Central Hospital. She sat in the emergency room office alone. The emergency department, which used to admit more than 1,500 patients a day, is now quiet. Only one homeless person lied there in the emergency hall.\n\nAccording to some previous news reports, Ai Fen, when she surfaced, was described as “another female doctor who has been warned”. Some people called her a whistleblower, but Ai Fen has corrected this statement— she is not a whistleblower, but the person who handed out the whistle. During the interview with People, Ai Fen mentioned the word “regret” multiple times. She regretted not being able to continue blowing the whistle after the “disciplinary discussion”, especially towards her peers who had passed away. “Had I known what would happen today, I would not care about all the reprimands and criticisms, and would speak up about it everywhere, right?”\n\nWhat have Ai Fen and the Wuhan Central Hospital experienced in the past two months? Below is Ai Fen’s narrative.\n\nThe unprecedented rebuke (This is a translation of Ai Fen recounting the story in her own words)\n\nOn December 16, 2020, our Emergency Department at the Nanjing Road Branch of Wuhan Central Hospital admitted a patient. The patient had an unexplainable high fever, The medication didn’t work and the body temperature didn’t come down. On December 22nd, the patient was transferred to the respiratory department and a bronchoscopy was performed, so that his/her alveolar lavage fluid could be acquired. The sample was sent to an external institution for high-throughput sequencing. Later, the result was informed orally, stating that it is coronavirus. At that time, a colleague who managed the hospital beds whispered several times in my ear: “Director Ai, that person is reported to be infected with coronavirus”. It was only afterwards that we found out the patient had worked in the Huanan Seafood Market (The first accused community-infected location).\n\nOn December 27th, another patient arrived at our Nanjing Road Branch. The patient was the nephew of a doctor in our department. He was in his 40s. He did not have any preexisting illness; however, his lungs were messed up and his blood oxygen saturation value was only 90% (A healthy individual should be above 94%). The hospital treated him for almost 10 days without any improvement, and the patient was transferred to the respiratory department. He also received a bronchoscopy, and his alveolar lavage fluid was sent out for testing.\n\nAt noon on December 30th, my classmate at Tongji Hospital sent me a screenshot through WeChat, which said: “Don’t go to the Huanan Seafood Market, many people came out with high fever …”. He asked me if this message was true. At the time, I was looking at the CT scan of a patient with typical pulmonary infection. I sent my classmate an 11-seconds video recorded from the CT scan and told him that this came from a patient who was admitted to our emergency room this morning. He also came from the Huanan Seafood Market.\n\nJust after 4 pm on December 30th, my colleague showed me a report that stated: SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 kinds of oral / respiratory colonization bacteria. I carefully and repeatedly read the report. One of the footnotes states: “SARS coronavirus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The main transmission modes of the virus are short-range airborne transmission of expiratory droplets or indirect contact with expiratory droplets of infected patients. This is a special pneumonia that can be significantly contagious and can affect multiple organ systems. This is also known as atypical pneumonia”.\n\nAt that time, I broke out in a cold sweat. This is a terrifying thing. Normally, when a patient is admitted to the respiratory care unit, the respiratory department should report this case. However, to play it safe, I immediately called and reported the situation to the hospital’s public health department and the infectious disease department. At that time, the director of our respiratory department happened to pass by my door. He was once involved in the SARS crisis. I grabbed him and said: “We have a patient who was admitted to your department and we found out that he is infected with coronavirus”. He glanced and immediately said: “This is troublesome. I knew this would be very concerning”.\n\nAfter calling the departments of the hospital, I also circulated this report to one of my classmates. I purposely circled the sentence “SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 types of oral/respiratory colonization bacteria” in red, to catch his attention. I also circulated the report in the doctor’s group chat to alert everyone to take precautions.\n\nOn the night of 30th December, the message was spread widely. The screenshot of the report with the red circle was everywhere. I found out later that the message doctor Li Wenliang (the famous whistleblower) passed around is the same screenshot. At that time, I smelled trouble. Around 10:20 pm, the hospital sent me a message, a notice from the city health committee. Essentially, it asked us to stop arbitrarily releasing information relating to the unknown pneumonia to avoid public panic. If panic is caused due to this information leakage, one should be held responsible.\n\nI was very scared at the time. I immediately forwarded the message to my classmate. About an hour later, the hospital sent another notice, emphasizing again that this internal pneumonia-related information should not be shared publicly. One day later, at 11:46 pm on 1st of January, 2020, the head of the hospital disciplinary committee sent me a message. He asked me to visit the committee the next morning.\n\nI couldn’t sleep that entire night. I was very worried and thought about this over and over again; yet I felt that there are always two sides to everything. Even if it caused adversity, it is not necessarily a bad thing to alert the medical staff in Wuhan to take precautions. Around eight o’clock the next morning, before I finished my shift, I was called immediately to the office.\n\nIn the meeting, I was subjected to an unprecedented and severe rebuke. The leader said: “We couldn’t raise our heads when we go out for meetings. You were directly criticized by another director. As the director of the emergency department of the Wuhan Central Hospital, you are a professional. How can you not have any principles and be so undisciplined to spread rumours?” These are his exact words. He wanted me to communicate verbally, either through face to face meeting or call one by one, to all 200+people in the department that we are not allowed to spread this pneumonia information via WeChat or SMS, “not even to our husbands”.\n\n\n", "English title": "The person who handed out the whistle — the warning of coronavirus (COVID-19)", "原文標題": "发哨子的人"}, {"slug": "896", "English content": "March 19, Beijing Sino-Japanese cooperation by the Hospital and Hospital of Wuhan Jinyintan together", "English title": "Anti-HIV Drugs Can't Shorten the Treatment Time for COVID-19 Patients, accoriding the Research published on The New England Journal of Medicine", "原文標題": "《新英格兰医学杂志》：抗艾滋药物未能缩短新冠患者病情改善时间"}, {"slug": "898", "English content": "The current epidemic occasion, February 10, the National People's Congress Law Committee said it has", "English title": "Amendement to Wild Animals Protection Act Has been Started.

Under the host of General Secretary Xi, it was the second time in about half a month that the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee had a meeting to study and deploy to strengthen epidemic prevention and control.\nThe meeting pointed out that it is necessary to improve the national emergency management system and improve the ability to deal with urgent and dangerous tasks in view of the shortcomings and shortcomings exposed in the response to the epidemic.\nCuring patients in Wuhan, all people are racing against time.\nSolve the difficulty of receiving and curing.\nOn the morning of February 2, after fighting for 9 days and nights, Huoshenshan Hospital has formally completed and put into use, which can provide 1000 beds, 1400 medical personnel deployed by the military have been in place. In the evening of February 3, the first batch of patients with COVID-19 went in Huoshenshan Hospital.\n\nOn the afternoon of February 3, the reporter visited the listed Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan. The inside and outside of the hospital were extremely nervous and busy, and all the people in each shift were ready to receive and cure the 1st batch of patients.\nThe “Brother” of Huoshenshan Hospital would also formally receive and cure patients on February 6, which can provide 1500 beds.\nOn the same day when Huoshenshan Hospital was completed and put into use, the Order No.10 was issued, which required centralized quarantine of all suspected patients.\nWuhan epidemic, the opportunity suddenly appeared.\nBefore this, many people and families in this city had experienced a long ordeal and a test of life and death.\nDial 120 and queue up; Dial the community and queue up up; Looking for \"Wuhan Neighborhood\", this platform collapsed on January 25.\nDuring the \"long\" waiting, there were more and more patients in Wuhan who took families as the unit. Some people had stayed up until the day when they had an available bed. At this time, one or two of his family members had been infected, and even the whole family has been infected, so they had to continue looking for beds.\nWhen someone had the available bed, they became seriously ill and died in ICU ward on New Year's Day.\nOn the morning of February 2, a patient's family told the “China Business Journal” reporter: \"The 89-year-old grandmother couldn't wait, fell down in the hospital corridor during queuing up, died on the second day of the New Year, and even had to queue up to the funeral home.

Before Wuhan carried out large-scale and high-frequency prevention and control of Covid-19, he had a heart stent operation.\n“It was assumed that he was infected when returning to hospital.”\nMrs. Dao memorized.\nOn January 23, uncle began to feel particularly unwell. On January 24, he went to Wuchang Hospital for CT and blood test, and was found that his lungs were infected and his condition was critical. The hospital issued an admission certificate, but there was no available bed.\nDial 120 and queue up; Dial the community and queue up; Looking for \"Wuhan Neighborhood\", this platform collapsed on January 25.\nAt this time, Mrs. Dao's cousin was taking care of her uncle, namely, the patient's son, while Mrs. Dao was helping to find available bed, made a phone call and asked for help from the outside world.\n\n\"We are crazy to dial the community, 120 and the mayor's hotline.

Xiao Zhu didn't want his father to worry about himself.\nXiao Zhu's grandmother, aged 89, had serious difficulty breathing due to lung infection. She finally went in the hospital in a shuttle bus arranged by the community on January 24. Before she could make a diagnosis, she didn't wait for an available bed. Her grandmother died in the corridor of Hankou Hospital on January 26.\n“Dad and uncle were taking care of grandma, dad is 65-year-old, I also worry about him.\nSeveral days ago, Xiao Zhu said when he accepted interview of this journal.\nShe was so scared, because her mum had passed away (not related to COVID-19) before, she was very worried about losing the kin again.\n“Dad and uncle live in grandma’s old house and quarantine, they haven't had a fever yet.”\nXiao Zhu told a reporter on February 2.\nXiao Zhu wanted to go out to buy some cold medicine, but the place where she lives was a bit special. \"I live opposite Hankou Railway Station, 800 meters away from it is the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, which is the hardest hit area, and there is no drugstore around.\".\nLiu Xiaoxuan has been fighting for 8 days at home, at this time she can only be awake for about 4 hours every day.\n\"I am very tired.

When I am tired, I have to sleep.\"\nAt this time, she was in her own home in Wuchang, and her father was hospitalized in Wuchang West District Hospital, and the symptoms of dyspnea eased; her mother is getting better, quarantined in maiden residence in Hankou, and still coughing.\nIt is her husband who has been supporting all the logistical work of this family by Xiaoxuan's side, and has started to have a low fever at present.\nIt was Xiaoxuan's mother who fell ill at first. Her father began to cough in the process of taking care of her, and did not have a fever at first, but the cough turned into difficulty breathing.\nAfter CT and blood test, her parents were orally diagnosed as Covid-19 by hospital doctors, and suffered from general weakness, difficulty breathing and inability to move.\nUnder such circumstances, Xiaoxuan didn't lose heart. She made a division of labor. Her husband was responsible for household disinfection and food supply, and she was responsible for going to the hospital with her parents, such as finding a hospital, registering and queuing.\nIn order to reduce the time for parents to be exposed to the cross-infection environment in hospital, Xiaoxuan usually queues by herself, and takes over her father or mother after the estimated time is almost up.\nOn January 25, Xiaoxuan was interviewed by our reporter. At that time, although it was very difficult and tired, her mother got better with the joint efforts of her whole family, which made Xiaoxuan not lose confidence.\n\"Not only must we ensure the nutrition of patients, but family members must also pay attention to eating and maintaining physical strength so as to fight the virus.\"\nXiao Zhu told reporter.\nShe also shared some nursing experiences on the Internet to encourage more patients and their families.\nHowever, since January 26, there were something wrong with Xiaoxuan’s body, and she has had a fever for many days since then. At that time, she was still encouraging herself, taking medicine, eating, and keeping physical strength, and she was bound to get better. She was also very struggled, and did not want to go to the hospital or be cross-infected.\nOn February 2, Xiaoxuan, who had been fighting disease continuously at home, still insisted on taking medicine, but obviously felt uncomfortable in her lungs.\n“Deep breathing is very hurt, but little breathing is OK.”\nShe told reporter.\nShe is preparing ID card for going to a doctor.\n\"The ID card is in mum’s home in Hankou, mum can't send it, and my husband can't go up and get it. Mom and dad got sick there.\"\nShe is also trying her friend's suggestions, such as Chinese medicine and massaging some acupoints, but some ideas make her stop insisting.\n“Now, I am following my husband.”\nShe said, “I am sick, and may be infected while taking care of my parent. I was OK before, maybe I was healthy, but maybe because the virus has infiltrated without showing.”\n\nNow I would like to remind my family members not to be careless when taking care of patients, even if necessary protection has been taken, the examination should be done as soon as possible. \"\nShe said that what she wants to do most now is not to take medicine or injection, but to go to the hospital and get a definite diagnosis from the doctor.\nRace against time\nCentralized quarantine of suspected patients and admission of confirmed patients will change the fate of these families.\nOn the evening of February 2, the headquarter of prevention and control of pneumonia epidemic in COVID-19 of Wuhan held a special dispatching meeting, which forced centralized quarantine for four groups of people, namely fever patients who were diagnosed, suspected and unable to rule out new pneumonia and close contacts of confirmed patients, and effectively controlled the source of infection by requisitioning a number of private hospitals, hotels, gymnasiums and other places.\nAt present, Wuhan has requisitioned 27 medical institutions, including Wuhan Minsheng Otolaryngology Hospital and other private chain specialized hospitals, which can provide 2,183 beds for treating suspected cases with negative results for the first time.\nOn the evening of February 3, the video dispatch meeting of the headquarter of pneumonia epidemic prevention and control in COVID-19 of Wuhan revealed that Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center will be transformed into three \"mobile cabin hospitals\" with a total of 3,400 beds.\nAt 1 pm on February 3, the reporter of “China Business Journal” contacted Yang Chen, the family member of the patient who had asked for help before, to inquire about the progress.\nYang Chen told reporters: \"The community mentioned to me Order No.10, saying that it will carry out relevant quarantine diagnosis and treatment according to the severity of the disease, but in terms of specific implementation, it just told me to wait.\"\nA community worker in Qiaokou District of Wuhan told reporters that the current situation in Wuhan is mainly caused by the shortage of beds, and we have no choice but to listen to the government's arrangement.\nAs early as January 26, Yang Chen contacted our reporter and told him that grandpa and his father were both suspected patients in COVID-19, but they failed to stay in the hospital after trying their best.\n\"The designated hospital told us that the bed was full and could not be treated, so let's contact the community to report it.\nHowever, the community asked us to go to designated hospitals directly.\nIn this way, it becomes an infinite loop. \"\nYang Chen told reporters: \"Because my family lives in Qiaokou District of Hankou, it is close to the South China Seafood Wholesales Market.\nBefore the Spring Festival in every year, family members come here to buy seafood.\nIn this year, grandpa went to buy seafood as usual, maybe he was infected with this virus due to this.”\nYang Chen mentioned that grandpa could not be diagnosed, and the whole family could not be quarantined as close contacts.\nTian Xiaoling, a native of Wuhan, is in the same situation as Yang Chen.\nOn January 30, Tian Xiaoling launched a social platform for help: \"I have been in Shanghai all the time, and I was blocked outside. Only through my relatives did I know that my mother was infected with COVID-19, and my father began to lose physic strength.\nThey are all in their fifties and sixties, and they have not received effective treatment until now. \"\nOn the afternoon of February 3, the reporter contacted Tian Xiaoling, who told the reporter that her mother had not been hospitalized successfully.\nThey would still wait.\nOrder No.10 races against time\nSolve medical care warranty\nAmong the patients in Wuhan, there are a group of \"special\" patients, who are doctors and are infected in the process of treating patients. In any major public health incident, the protection of medical personnel is the most important link.\nThis is same with SARS 17 years ago, and the epidemic situation is still the same, now.\nThe government is also seeking the answer to this question.\nThere are only two paths, namely, reasonable arrangement of the work intensity of medical personnel and allocation of adequate and standard medical and protective materials.\nBy 20: 00 on February 2, a total of 57 medical teams and 6775 medical team members were assigned to 27 designated medical institutions in Wuhan.\nDr. Wang from Beijing, who supports the work of Tongji Hospital Sino-French Branch, told this reporter: \"As soon as the new ward is opened, there will be a steady stream of heavy patients, and there are many patients, and the number of patients will continue to grow.\"\n\"One shift of us works 6 hours, wear protective clothing, can't eat or drink water in the ward, and need to wear diapers.\nWearing diapers is also for the convenience of leaving the hospital. All clothes can be destroyed to prevent infection. “\nDr. Wang said.\n\"After finishing the work, everyone's lining clothes are all soaked. In order to prevent infection, the central air conditioner can't be turned on in the ward, and there is no heating in Wuhan. It is very cold after taking off the protective clothing, and there is no condition to take a bath in the hospital.\nIn order to reduce the risk of infection, we think of some local methods, such as making shoe covers with garbage bags and tape. “\nDr. Wang said.\nHowever, before all this turned around, many medical personnel were still infected in the process of diagnosis and treatment of the epidemic.\nTian Liwen is the head nurse in the quarantine ward of a ward in Central Hospital of Wuhan.\nIn an interview with “China Business Journal”, he said that the front line is very difficult, and everyone is working with a sense of responsibility.\nThe ward is mainly for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nTian Liwen said: \"A large number of medical personnel in our hospital has collapsed. Now it has become the  surgeons and nurses who treat patients with respiratory diseases.\"\nShe introduced: \"The whole hospital is now very saturated, so is our workload and the number of beds.\nIn fact, according to the standard process, if there are confirmed cases among colleagues around us, the medical personnel we have had close contact with should be quarantined for observation for 14 days. However, the hospital is short of medical personnel, and CT examination is still negative for those like us who are not infected or ill, so we should not be quarantined and stick to the front line. \"\n\"A group of nurses in hospital has been exhausted, and a group of nurses asked for leave to rest.\nTherefore, there is no way at present. If the subsequent support forces are rotated, we will probably stick to it all the time. \"\nTian Liwen told reporters that the most anxious thing for everyone is actually this problem. \"The nurses in our clinical department ask me every day: head nurse, when will someone come to take shift?\"\n\"We have 4 or 5 colleagues who have been infected and then diagnosed. It is reasonable to say that we should be quarantined last week, but as far as the current situation is concerned, it seems that no one can really substitute them, and we all have to insist on going to work.\"\nTian Liwen said helplessly, \"If medical personnel have symptoms such as fever, we have to take CT of the lungs, and then do nucleic acid testing. If it is diagnosed, it needs hospitalization and quarantine treatment. The hospitalization of medical staff in our hospital can now be guaranteed.\"\nIt is understood that at present, Central Hospital of Wuhan has taken over Wuhan Hankou Hospital, and some medical personnel have been urgently transferred from surgical departments to support it.\n\"Now the number of patients is too large, and the team of doctors and nurses from other places has come, but it is still far from enough, and patients can't be treated.\"\nAccording to Tian Liwen’s introduction, doctors are now changing shifts every four hours, and nurses are not enough, so they need to change shifts every six hours.\n\"For example, I am from 8: 00 am to 2: 00 pm. I don't eat, drink or go to the toilet for 6 hours.\"\nRegarding the process of receiving patients, Tian Liwen told reporters that patients receive and treat according to the standard procedures.\nBesides ordinary patients who come to the fever clinic, they are usually screened in the community hospital where they are located first, and then if there are problems such as severe fever, they will be sent to the designated fever hospital clinic according to the procedure. Outpatient doctors will determine whether to treat them according to the screening criteria, and then they will do nucleic acid detection after admission.\nAs for the change of outpatient volume, Tian Liwen said that this is not easy to compare intuitively.\nFor example, in our comprehensive hospital, all diseases were treated, but now some wards in our hospital only treat suspected or confirmed patients.\n\"At present, it is okay. There is no special situation. Everyone is in short supply of protective materials every day. The hospital has been preparing for it and can basically meet it. At least it is sufficient when we go to work every day. It just means that sometimes the quality is better and sometimes the quality is worse.\"\nWuhan Jinyintan Hospital, as a professional hospital for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in Wuhan, was the first to receive the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the first-line medical staff also adhered to it for the longest time. At present, only confirmed cases were treated.\nA nurse in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, who asked not to be named, told the reporter that there were 8 people in a shift in the intensive care unit and 40 pieces of protective clothing were issued.\nThe admission and diagnosis of related cases are arranged by doctors, and nurses are not clear about the specific situation.\n\"Now basically, some suspected patients are referred by the community neighborhood committees and community hospitals where the patients are located, but many communities are not in place.\"\nAccording to a family member of an infected nurse in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, she has not left the ICU yet, and it is not convenient to talk.\nUnder the communication of the family, the nurse indirectly declined the interview.\nOn the morning of February 2, the second batch of 6 infected medical staff were discharged from the Union Hospital affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology.\nAccording to CCTV.com, the clinical symptoms of the six infected medical personnel were effectively controlled after treatment, and they met the discharge standards after discussion by the expert group.\nIt is understood that up to now, 9 of the 15 infected medical personnel in Union Hospital have been cured and discharged, and 6 are still being treated in quarantine.\nThe reporter contacted Liu Xiang with effort, a medical staff who was still in quarantine treatment at Union Hospital.\nAccording to his introduction, he is in good health at present.\n\"Still waiting for the last nucleic acid test, I can be discharged from the hospital if I am negative.\"\nRegarding the specific treatment process and other information, the medical staff said: \"There is discipline and cannot be interviewed.\"\nOn January 25, ByteDance announced that it would donate RMB 200 million to the China Red Cross Foundation, and set up the \"China Red Cross Foundation ByteDance Medical Workers Humanitarian Relief Fund\" to provide financial support for frontline medical workers who were diagnosed with pneumonia in COVID-19.\nAccording to the reporter of China Business Journal, as of February 2, the fund has announced 6 batches and 57 recipients.\nMost of the medical staff diagnosed with infection came from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital and other medical units.\nAmong them, there were 22 doctors and nurses infected with Covid-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital, 7 confirmed medical personnel in Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, 6 confirmed medical personnel in Tongji Hospital and Zhongnan Hospital, and 5 confirmed medical personnel in Wuhan Hanyang Hospital.\nOvercoming medical bottleneck?\nThe other side of \"difficult receiving and curing\" and \"doctor-patient infection\" is the extreme pressure on medical resources in Wuhan since the outbreak of the epidemic.\nOn February 1, a reporter from China Business Journal visited the fever clinic on the first floor of Tongji Emergency Center.\nOutpatient hall is full of patients who come for infusion and oxygen inhalation, and the cough sounds one after another.\nDue to the lack of beds, many patients bring their own folding beds and receive oxygen therapy in the aisles.\nOne day after that, Huoshenshan Hospital was completed, and the tenth order was issued. One day later, Huoshenshan Hospital began to receive patients.\nFor Wuhan, it almost uses space to exchange time.\nBefore that, facing the epidemic, the medical hospitals in Wuhan had already reached the limit.\n\"There are many patients in Tongji Hospital every day, and the flow of people is very large.\"\nA patient who is seeing a doctor in Tongji Hospital told reporters.\n\"We mobilized all doctors to invest in the front line. Except physicians, infectious disease doctors, including surgeons and anesthesiologists, they all trained and let them all invest in the front line.\"\nWang Wei, Dean of Tongji Hospital, once introduced.\nHowever, it is still difficult to meet the needs of overcrowded fever clinics.\n\"It's easy to cross-infect here. At present, my mother and I rent an apartment near Tongji Hospital, go to take IV every day, and come back after IV.\nBasically, when we take injections, we also take them outside, but the queue time in the hospital is very long, which is also the longest time we stay in the hospital. \"\nOne patient told reporters.\nYang Chen's family was also compelled to choose to quarantine themselves at home.\nAs early as January 26, he told reporters that there was no environment to quarantine patients at home.\n\"Two rooms, two patients, five people, how we are quarantined?\"\nYang Chen bluntly expressed his concern: \"There is no quarantine environment at our home, and I don't know when I will be infected.\nI take care of my sick family at home, and I need to go out to buy food, which inevitably leads to more people being threatened by viruses. \"\nOn the afternoon of February 3rd, when Yang Chen was interviewed by reporters again, her voice was a little weak: \"I only know that my grandmother and I went to the hospital yesterday, and we have diagnosed inflammation of the lungs.\nGrandpa is dying, and he hasn't been tested for nucleic acid yet. \"\nTian Xiaoling, who lives in Shanghai, is even more upset. The two old people are quarantined at home and left unattended.\n\"Because the two old people are infected with the virus and there are no private cars at home, they have made countless calls to the community, and there is no car to send them to do nucleic acid testing.\"\nTian Xiaoling mentioned that because there are more people doing nucleic acid detection, they still need to queue up, which takes one day and one night.\n\"Even if I call 120 to send them to the hospital, how can they come back?\nThe designated hospitals are full. Where are the beds? “\n\"The basic procedure is to register, measure body temperature, measure blood oxygen concentration and record personal information first, and then call the number and see the attending doctor. After the doctor prescribes the medicine or the checklist, he will write a list and go to the pharmacy to take the medicine or do the examination.\nAfter prescribing the medicine, you should wait in another line to take the medicine, and then find the nurse who is in charge of injection for infusion after dispensing the medicine. “\nOne patient told the report of our journal\nMany doctors working in Tongji Hospital told reporters that many doctors were infected with COVID-19 in fever clinic.\nWorried that if one's infection is transmitted to his family; it is also for the convenience of work. After work, the doctors in the fever clinic of our hospital concentrate on staying in the city express hotel opposite the hospital.\n\"Almost every one of us is exposed, but everyone is still facing up.\"\nAn oncologist told reporters.\nWhat are the reasons for this problem?\nA neurosurgeon at the AAA hospitals in the head said: \"The first is the bed, and the compliant bed is far from enough; the second are materials, consumption is far greater than supply. \"\nAs for the test kit, a doctor from Wuhan No.4 Hospital revealed that as long as the hospital is hospitalized, it will basically do nucleic acid test, and the patient can only be discharged from the hospital if the throat swab is negative twice.\nHowever, some doctors have reported that it is very difficult for people around them to do nucleic acid testing.\n\"It's hard to test, it's not necessarily that the kit is not enough.\nIt may also be that there are not so many doctors to do it, they are too busy, or there is not so much machine space.\nIt may even be that there are not so many staff, but it may also be that there are not so many protective clothing, so there are no staff with proper protective equipments, and we can’t let these staff work without protection.\n“The problem should be one link at a time. \"\nA senior emergency doctor at Peking Union Medical College Hospital thinks.\n\n\"People have to be hospitalized after testing, and the storage capacity is limited. People can only be tested when they are hospitalized, and they have to go through the process.\nOur front line is very distressed, and we are caught in an infinite loop. “\nHowever, some doctors believe that it is not necessarily the most important thing for patients with mild and moderate diseases to be diagnosed as coronavirus infection.\nIts main problem is not anti-virus, but symptomatic treatment, and this symptom depends on its degree of light, medium or heavy.\nIf the symptoms are very mild, patients only need quarantine, drink plenty of water, properly use anti-virus and anti-infection drugs, keep sleeping and strengthen nutrition.\nThis virus can easily attach to invade the mucosal cells in the lungs.\n\"At present, hospitalization is mainly symptomatic treatment, allowing patients to survive the dangerous period, maintaining the stability of various functions, oxygen inhalation due to lack of oxygen, adding some infectious drugs and antiviral drugs to infected patients, and supplementing some electrolytes with incomplete electrolytes. Globulin supports therapy, and some anti-AIDS drugs such as Klebsiella can also be used, but the current clinical quantity of this drug is far from enough.\"\nAnother deputy chief doctor holds a similar view.\n\"Whether this disease is refractory depends on the basic condition of the patient, and young people can come over when they can; Secondary to the elderly, the anti-infection ability is poor; Very few children have this disease. \"\nA doctor working in a 3A hospital told the reporter that he was in quarantine at present. Recently, a colleague coughed and had a CT scan, and his lungs had virus-like changes. As a doctor who had been in close contact with this colleague, he also needed quarantine.\n\"Once CT shows virus pneumonia, 95% of them are infected with COVID-19.\nDoctors are more likely to infect their colleagues if they are poisoned. After all, they are not completely quarantined. “\nThe doctor said.\nHowever, his colleagues did not do nucleic acid testing.\nOn the one hand, it is because his colleagues have recovered almost at present, and they don't want to make a kit.\nOn the other hand, the sick doctor is worried about the risk of cross-infection caused by nucleic acid testing.\nAt present, the fever clinic collects oropharyngeal swabs for influenza and COVID-19 RT-PCR.\n\"The people who take the materials are also high-risk groups, which may be contagious. When they are not good at taking materials, they will cross-infect.\"\nThe aforementioned doctor told reporters.\n\"Wuhan requires a lot of people to do nucleic acid detection, and the kit may not be available.\nEven if our doctors do nucleic acid detection by themselves, they can't do it if they want to, but only through the examination and approval of department leaders.\nIn addition, the disease is more evil, and even after it is cured, it will cross-infect.\nThe so-called “recovery”, is to achieve a balance.\nOnce this virus rises again, it may come again. “\nThe doctor said.\nThe winter, time and history of Wuhan will give the answer.\n", "English title": "\"Deleted\" Wuhan patients: more and more family-based patients and queues to funeral homes - Column - Love Stocks", "原文標題": "【被删除】武汉病人：以家庭为单位的患者越来越多，去殡仪馆也得排队 - 专栏 - 爱股票"}, {"slug": "933", "English content": "Wuhan City ⾥ gray discolored ⽣ Italy\n  archive.is/95mBj\n                                      13 yea", "English title": "\"Deleted\" Gray business in Wuhan city", "原文標題": "【被删除】武汉城里的灰色生意"}, {"slug": "934", "English content": "Wuhan ⼥ Face beautiful carry off three days ⼗\n  archive.is/9NZ90\n                                   ", "English title": "\"Deleted\" The 30 days Wuhan woman Guan Xiuli endured", "原文標題": "【被删除】武汉女人关秀丽扛起的三十天"}, {"slug": "935", "English content": "Wuhan community volunteers fare sale ⽣ live material?

The patient didn't eat at home for 5 days, and didn't have fever or cough.\nI have a history of close contact with this patient, because he couldn't stand up when he came. I lift him to bed with several other doctors, nurses and family members.\nI immediately arranged to draw blood and gave him chest CT. At that time, his condition was serious, which was a typical CT sign of viral lung. According to the latest diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Commission of People’s Republic of China at that time, he could be identified as a suspected case.\nBecause there was no available bed in the respiratory department, he waited until there was a bed in the respiratory department at night before turning around.\nThe second case was a woman who said she had abdominal pain.\nShe said she had abdominal pain, but it was actually a symptom of gastrointestinal indigestion.\nThe patient knows that she has a lung infection.\nBefore she came to me, she went to the respiratory department for treatment. After taking CT, the doctor gave her an admission certificate. As a result, because there was no bed, she wanted to come to our department.\nActually, she had a history of fever and cough for several days, but she didn't tell me when I asked about the history, and she didn't tell me until I checked her outpatient medical records and examination results.\nThere is also a patient transferred from ICU of our hospital, and the cause of jaundice needs to be investigated.\nDuring his stay in hospital, he had fever and symptoms of lung infection, but after a week's reexamination, he did not improve significantly. The patient was later transferred to another designated hospital.\nWhen receiving these three patients, I only wore a white coat, a two-layer surgical mask and an ordinary disposable hat for surgery without Level-3 protection.\nAt that time, our hospital was already in short supply, and only respiratory department, emergency department and intensive care department were equipped with Level-3 protection.\nWe had Level-2 protection.\nOn January 21, our hospital was notified to become a designated hospital.\n\nThe 1st night in the designated hospital\nOn the second day after receiving the transfer order, we emptied the whole hospital to treat patients with viral lung.\nIn the afternoon, the hospital gave us a meeting to talk about how to carry out Level-3 prevention.\nHowever, under the condition that the hospital materials were not fully equipped at that time, it was difficult for all of us to do Level-3 protection.\nOn January 22, some departments of the hospital were transformed into infusion rooms, which gave a large number of outpatients infusion and observation.\nAn infusion room can hold about 8 people and can receive more than 50 patients at one time.\nAt 7:00PM, we started to receive patients.\nAt that time, the ward was not open yet, and a large number of patients poured in and stayed in the outpatient and infusion rooms.\nOn the night of the January 22, 200 patients came here successively. In order to give patients injections and infusions, the nurses worked in the assembly line and were exhausted\nSome doctors and nurses, only wore the ordinary surgical masks with two layers and started receiving patients.\nA father and grandmother, who probably didn't know that our place had been changed into a designated hospital, rushed here with their kid in their arms, saying that their kid had a fever of 40 degrees and wanted to be infused.\nAt that time, our wards were full of patients with viral lung. I was afraid that the three of them were infected with the virus, so I was anxious to drive them out quickly.\nI said, we wouldn’t receive kids here. There were all viruses. You should go to pediatrics.\nThey said, the pediatrics building has been blocked, how can I go there.\nDue to lack of guidance, no one told them that the pediatrics building has been blocked and where to go.\nI also have a kid, and can fully understand their feelings. I want to take them there, but there are still lots of patients to be treated, I cannot leave.\nAfter explaining the situation to them, they ran away quickly.\nLack of guidance boards, lack of guidance staff, patients sometimes went to the wrong places in hospitals.\nFor some patients, when doctors watched their films, they know that they are viral lungs, but they feel that they are not and others are, and they are afraid that others will walk around and infect them.\n\nBecause there were many patients, we were too busy. Nurses never stopped giving injections to patients, and there were no people to help us maintain order. Therefore, patients and their families were impatient after waiting for a long time.\nThat night, a nurse gave a patient an injection, and asked the patient to take the infusion bag or bottle to find a stool. The patient was dissatisfied and swearing, and asked the nurse to carry the infusion bag or bottle to his seat. Another colleague was afraid of the patient's noise, so he was led to the stool to appease him.\n\nMy colleagues and I noticed that the disease was in early January.\nAt that time, there was the file of the National Health and Family Planning Commission to check the unknown pneumonia in Wuhan.\nOur hospital had a department director's proposal to set up a special quarantine ward.\nUnfortunately, this opinion was not adopted in the end.\nClinical doctors were nervous and cautious, but at that time the hospital was short of materials.\nIf it’s not front-line department, there was no Level-3 protection for medical personnel. Front-line departments such as emergency department, respiratory department and ICU are also in short supply.\nIn order to saving, when we wear protective clothing, we will wear surgical quarantine gown outside, so that, even if the surgical gown is lost and the protective clothing can still be used.\nFor a time, one protective clothing and three nurses took turns to wear it. If one of them was a potential infected person, it would be very troublesome.\nWe don’t need money now, we only need materials to protect ourselves.\nIf the shortage of materials continues, the infected medical care will only increase, which will also affect the development of diagnosis and treatment.\nIn these days, we encountered with some inconvenience. \nAt 10: 00 on January 23, Wuhan was locked down, and the buses in the city stopped, which made it inconvenient for many doctors to go to work.\nDoctors are also potential infected people, so they are not suitable for walking on the road. Therefore, we contacted some hotels, which were not willing to let us stay.\nFortunately, in recent days, people with good intentions came to help us, and colleagues stayed in the hotel.\nSome people had special difficulties. For example, a couple had to go to the front line, and the elderly couldn’t take care of their kids. The husband asked if he can take his wife's shift and let her take care of the kid at home.\nThe outside world donated some materials to Wuhan, but for some reason, my colleagues and I haven't got them yet.\nThe directors of some departments contacted the donated materials for the sake of the people managed by them.\nOur director got us a batch, which can last for about a week, but other departments were not clear.\nThe director said, hold on, and wait for supplies to go to the battlefield.\nSome patients fell out of the clinic, and their bodies were left untreated for some time.\nLater, my colleagues who went to the scene told me that people from the funeral parlor arrived at the scene and said that this kind of corpse should be treated specially, and asked us to wrap the corpse by ourselves.\nSome people on the Internet said that it was a rumor that the corpses cannot be treated in time, and I was very angry when I saw it.\nThis is not the case in normal times. When a patient declares death, we call the funeral parlor and the funeral parlor will handle it directly.\nSome of the patients I contacted on that day were already dying when I saw them, and some of them were because their diseases developed rapidly and their oxygen saturation was only 40. These patients were respiratory failure and their oxygen saturation was not good.\nOxygen inhalation is useless. We need a ventilator. We couldn't take it in the intensive care unit. We didn't have a ventilator in our department.\nEven if there was one, it would not be used if it was not a respiratory doctor or nurse without guidance and training before.\nWithout test kit, everything was stopped by “suspended case”.\nUnexpectedly, I went to work for only one day under such circumstances, and I fell down.\nOn January 22, the first day of becoming a designated hospital, I started working at 7: 00 in the evening, and worked all night. At 8: 00 the next morning, I started to feel sore throat and chest tightness.\nI had a rest at home that day, and I started to have fever and low fever from noon, which aroused my vigilance, so I went to a nearby hospital to see a doctor.\nAt that time, I had a fluke mentality, thinking that it was only respiratory infection, so I went to our hospital for CT, where the virus density was relatively high, but there was a risk of infection.\nAs a result, I got the examination report, and according to the CT results, I was also \"got hit\".\nNow is the third day of my illness. I still have intermittent fever and fatigue, but I have no symptoms of chest tightness.\nFrom my CT results, the infection focus is not big, it should be early stage.\nIt may be related to my frequent contact with patients, intense work and decreased resistance.\nNow, I'm quarantined at home.\nMy mother cooked chicken soup for me every day and sent it to me by my husband.\nIf I wanted to go to the front line, I had to be quarantined from my family, because even if I was not ill, it was also a potential source of infection, and I was afraid of infecting them.\nThe child was sent away long ago. When I contacted and accepted the 73-year-old man, I showed him CT, which was a typical CT manifestation in the diagnostic criteria and knew that he was a suspected case.\nAfter seeing him, I called my mother and asked her to take the baby away and live with her grandparents.\nNow, my mother sent me some videos of kids every day to encourage me.\nMy kid could say: Mum, love you.\nSo lovely, I hoped I can be recovered earlier, and accompany with him.\nMy situation is not in the officially announced number of infected people.\nAccording to the criteria of diagnosis and treatment at that time, it can only be confirmed as a confirmed case after reagent test.\nI consulted in our hospital and another designated hospital, but I didn't get the chance to do reagent test.\nWithout the test results of the kit, there was no basis to say that you have been diagnosed. No matter what the situation was, it could only be considered as a suspect.\nI didn't know if it is a work-related injury if I was really infected with this disease, but it couldn't be diagnosed. Many medical personnel should have the same confusion as me.\nI didn't know how long the special situation would last.\nWuhan Xiaotangshan (referring to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital) is under construction, and materials were being transported to Wuhan.\nToday, Wuhan informed that motor vehicles will not be able to hit the road from January 26.\nThere should be fewer patients, and it may end soon, and I hope it will end soon.\n* The party information has fuzzy processing\nWrittent by | Wen Lihong\n\n", "English title": "\"Deleted\" Confessions of an infected doctor in Wuhan - Zhihu", "原文標題": "【被删除】一个武汉被感染医生的自述 - 知乎"}, {"slug": "940", "English content": "⼀ 70-year-old patient with suspected pneumonia new crown Death - Economic Observer ⽹ - New professio", "English title": "\"Deleted\" The death of a 70-year-old suspected COVID-19 patient - Economic Observer.

Indeed, there are many people under the shadow of cracks. In fact, there are not a few of them. If you count the number of them, it is really a lot.” \n\nWritten by｜Jing Xinyu, An Xiaoqing\nEditted by｜Tang Qi\n\n“Please help our family, we really cannot find any other methods.”\nOn the morning of January 1, the citizen Zhou Zhe in Wuhan typed out the first line of words on his Weibo for helping his father. \nZhou Zhe's father is a dialysis patient and needs to go to Wugang Hospital for dialysis three times a week.\nHe recalled that, a week ago, his father was in a state of high fever, vomiting and general weakness. He suspected that his father was infected with COVID-19 because \"he didn't know the seriousness of the problem at the early stage and didn't wear any protective measures such as a mask when he went to the hospital for dialysis\".\nIn the next three days, Zhou Zhe's father was diagnosed as \"highly suspected\" by doctors. However, due to the shortage of test kits, the original dialysis hospital refused to carry out follow-up dialysis treatment for the elderly, and he could not be accepted by the designated hospital in COVID-19 because he could not be diagnosed.\nHemodialysis is a routine treatment for acute and chronic kidney failure.\nExcess water and toxins are removed by taking blood out of the body and using the principles of dialysis and filtration, and then injected into the patient.\nDialysis patients usually go to the hospital dialysis room for dialysis once or three times a week according to the doctor's advice, each time for 3 to 4 hours.\nExcept kidney transplant patients, all patients with kidney failure need lifelong dialysis.\nOnce dialysis is interrupted, it may endanger life safety.\nZhou Zhe recalled that, in those days, they sought medical treatment everywhere every day. \"Like a mobile source of infection, we were afraid of infecting other people, but there was really nothing we could do. 」\nOn February 2, Zhou Zhe's father finally queued in the hospital for nucleic acid test, but before the test results came out, the old man died unfortunately on the morning of February 3.\nGreat changes, which are equally severe and rapid, also occurred in Fang Hui's family.\nSince February 1, Fang Hui has been looking for a bed for father who is suspected to be infected with COVID-19 and needs dialysis daily.\nFang Hui told “Portrait” that the father needed to go to Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine for dialysis twice a week because of diabetic kidney failure.\n\nThree weeks ago, the mother who went to dialysis with father had fever and fatigue, and CT showed that her lungs were infected. However, because she could not be diagnosed, her condition turned sharply within eight days, and unfortunately she died in the early morning of January 31.\nThe next day, Fang Hui, who had not yet emerged from the grief of her mother's sudden death, took her father to the hospital for ruling out and found that father's lungs were also infected (later diagnosed as Covid-19).\nThe hospital refused Fang Hui's father's request to continue the next dialysis because the hospital was not the designated one for Covid-19.\nFang Hui went to several designated hospitals for COVID-19 that can implement dialysis as mentioned in previous government documents. \"Some said that the hospital area is still undergoing renovation, and they don't have the conditions. Some of them have no available beds. I have been running for 8 days, but there was still no bed. At midnight yesterday, the community informed us to go to the hospital for hospitalization. The hospital said that they didn't know who the docking person was and couldn't be treated.\n\"We'll report it, wait for the news.\" This sentence will always be given to you.\nCan only continue to wait, there is no other method.\nAs Wuhan has \"banned cars\" and the traffic is inconvenient, Fang Hui can only ride a shared electric scooter between hospital and home every time.\nOne-day last week, he took his father to the hospital for dialysis. \"I rode a shared electric car for almost two hours, and changed three times in the middle. I was fine, and my dad was tortured to death.”\nFor more than 10,000 patients with kidney disease who need to go to hospital for dialysis regularly in Wuhan, the spread of the epidemic, the high risk of infection, the lockdown of the city and the consequent ban on private cars have thrown them into an embarrassing situation and a grey interval.\nZhi An, the initiator of the non-profit organization \"Kidney·Like People\", told “Portrait” that for ordinary dialysis patients who are not infected with COVID-19, dialysis is basically no longer a problem with the requisitioned hospitals opening dialysis rooms one after another under the appeal of patients, non-profit organizations and media reports. The currently urgent problem lies in materials and travel.\n“For example, the masks.\nThree masks are needed for one dialysis (It takes about 3-4 hours to one dialysis. It needs one mask in the dialysis room and one on each way back and forth.) Many patients don't have masks anymore ... Others can stay at home for a week, and stay for ten days or half a month without going out. That's no problem, but they can't.\nIf they don't go to dialysis, they can't sustain their lives.” Zhi An said.\nHowever, Zhi An told “Portrait” that for many dialysis patients who have been diagnosed or suspected of COVID-19, \"they are in dilemma.” It’s especially hard to find bed.”\nAt present, Wuhan has arranged 7 designated hospitals for patients with kidney failure and hemodialysis.\nHowever, according to the accounts of many renal dialysis patients, hospitals do not accept individuals and need community referral.\nIn recent days, the beds in these hospitals are basically full.\nIn addition, in the interview, “Portrait” also learned about the plight of another special group - some people with chronic kidney disease, because of long-term lung effusion, chronic lung inflammation existed for a long time.\nHowever, in this special period when all the symptoms related to \"lung\" will attract attention, they are required to do nucleic acid tests repeatedly to prove that they are not infected with COVID-19.\nThey did, but they were told that the accuracy of nucleic acid test is still to be considered.\nThey were unable to go to 7 designated hospitals and were not admitted to ordinary dialysis rooms.\nThey became real people who had nowhere to go for dialysis.\nIn a huge battle against viruses, some people were put in an awkward and grey situation.\nThe reporter of “Portrait” interviewed the family members of 3 dialysis patients in COVID-19 epidemic, and one family member said: \"In this process, everyone always sees the main body. Indeed, there are many people under the shadow of cracks. In fact, there are not a few of them. If you count the number of them, it is really a lot. “\n1\nThe following is Lu Fan's self-statement.\nHis grandmother superimposed suspected COVID-19 patients for dialysis patients, and died at home on February 5.\nMy grandmother is 78 years old and has been undergoing dialysis for 3 years. She goes to Zhongnan Hospital affiliated to Wuhan University for dialysis 3 times a week.\nAt the beginning of January, Grandma began to have a fever and felt uncomfortable. After going to the hospital for examination, she said that her lungs were infected. At that time, COVID-19 had not yet fully erupted, and she stayed in the hospital for about 7 or 8 days. When the fever was gone, the hospital let her go out of the hospital, but the problem of lung infection was not completely solved, just that the situation improved.\nOn January 25, Grandma began to have a fever again. At that time, COVID-19 had already broken out, and we were very afraid, because she had to go to the hospital for dialysis 3 times a week, and the dialysis room was full of patients with poor immunity.\nSo we were worried about whether it was COVID-19, so we took grandma to Zhongnan Hospital for CT and blood test.\nThe CT result was highly suspected of COVID-19, but Zhongnan Hospital didn't have a test kit at that time and couldn't do nucleic acid test, so let us go home and quarantine ourselves.\nGrandma's condition is getting worse every day, and Zhongnan Hospital has refused to let my grandmother go to dialysis since February 1.\nThe reason for rejection is that the dialysis ward of Zhongnan Hospital does not have an quarantined dialysis ward for Covid-19 patients. If COVID-19 goes in for dialysis, more than a dozen people in a big room may infect other people.\nWithout regular dialysis, grandma's body collapsed very quickly.\nMy family went to Liyuan Hospital affiliated to Huake, where a batch of kits just arrived.\nOriginally the result should be taken on the next day, however, on the next day, Liyuan Hospital said the test result was missed, then we did the test again.\nAt that time, grandma was exhausted and needed a lift, couldn’t go upstairs nor walk.\nWaiting for another day, the result showed that it was negative.\nWe were very happy. We took Grandma to Zhongnan Hospital with the results, hoping that Grandma could be hospitalized and continue dialysis.\nBut the director of Nephrology Department of Zhongnan Hospital looked at our nucleic acid test results and then looked at CT. His original words were, \"Through this CT observation, I think this is basically COVID-19.\nI don't quite agree with the results of this nucleic acid test, which has certain errors. “\nTherefore, he refused to receive my grandma for treatment.\nI didn’t blame him.\nLater, a friend of mine in a hospital told me that the accuracy of the nucleic acid test kit was not high.\nI didn't know how many families delayed the treatment opportunity because of this kit, and how many medical staff were infected because of the wrong test kit.\nAfter the doctor said that he didn't recognize the result, asked us to go to the 7 designated hospitals in Wuhan to have another test.\nBut on the afternoon when we went to Zhongnan Hospital to see him, Grandma was in a coma, and we couldn't do another nucleic acid test, and she was already in shock.\nThe doctor said there was nothing he could do, because there was no bed and no medical resources, and he couldn't treat, so we had to find our own way.\nDuring this period, we contacted the community, and the community contacted the Health Commission for us. The Health and Health Commission told us through the community that there was nothing they could do, because there was really no bed and no rescue power.\nWe have contacted many hospitals by ourselves, but ordinary hospitals didn't accept patients with fever. They all said that my grandmother is a suspected COVID-19 patient, and she needed to go to a designated hospital.\nWe contacted the designated hospital for COVID-19, and they said that Grandma had not been diagnosed and could not accept her.\nIt was in an endless loop, all hospitals didn't accept her.\nMy grandma was like in the grey zone of crack.\nWe also called 120, and were saying that the patient was in shock, the situation was very critical, and we needed first aid. The answer given to us by 120 was that there was nothing they could do. They said that the premise of the ambulance coming was that we had to find a hospital willing to treat grandma, then they could come, otherwise there would be no place to go when the ambulance came.\nHe said that they have seen too much recently. They once took a patient to 3 or 4 hospitals, and all of them were turned away.\nFrom the afternoon of February 4 to the present (afternoon of February 5), Grandma could only lie at home, and has no response. She had no response, only breathing, and couldn't eat or drink water.\n(Editor's Note: On the afternoon of February 5, the National Health Commission of People’s Republic of China issued the \"Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Pneumonia Infected with COVID-19 (Trial Fifth Edition)\", which stipulated that CT imaging results should be taken as the diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis cases in Hubei Province. )\nIncluding myself entering some help groups, QQ groups and WeChat groups, many cases are similar to ours, namely, many patients who are not from COVID-19 (with other diseases) are also asking for help because he cannot get a basic treatment guarantee.\nBefore the lungs were infected, my grandmother was in good health. She had no problem taking a bath and eating by herself, and her self-care ability was OK.\nBut since the outbreak, there have been lots of sudden changes in life.\nThis change is very fast and a bit unreal.\nBecause on the Chinese New Year's Eve, Grandma had dinner with us.\nMy two children, twins, have just been born for 3 months. Grandma has an old idea that she has been undergoing dialysis and is a patient. It is not good for her to see babies, so on Chinese New Year's Eve it was the first time she saw and held babies.\nAt that time, my family also said that I would find a photo studio to take a family photo of 4 generations, but it didn't work out, which is a great regret for me.\nThe whole thing was developing so fast that it really felt like a wartime state now.\nThis was also a shame.\nBecause of kids’ birth, the family told me to go to the hospital less and meet with everyone less.\nBefore I had no children, my cousin and I took turns to pick up my grandma for dialysis.\nAfter the outbreak of COVID-19, my family wouldn't let me go, because there was a certain risk. If I got sick, I might be fine when I was young, but it was a great risk to bring it back to my babies.\nSo I haven’t met my grandma for long time.\nEven right now, she is in shock, lying down and dying at home, I really want to see her, but my reason tells me to forget it.\nI felt very sad.\nActually, before the outbreak, my wife and I felt something was wrong in the hospital.\nAt the end of December last year, my wife and I went to the hospital for postpartum examination. At that time, COVID-19 had already attracted the attention of the hospital, because at that time, a separate fever clinic had been set up, and the number of people waiting in line for CT was several times as high as before. In addition, the protective measures of medical staff had been put on masks, but at that time, we could not feel this abnormality and tension at home.\nI couldn't feel it when I walked on the road, because it was rare to see someone wearing a mask.\nAt that time, I felt a little strange when I was in the hospital, because there were some news on the Internet at that time, so after we went home, we both felt that this matter might not be as small and easy as we seemed and felt, and there might be some serious problems.\nAt that time, we began to dissuade our elders from going out less and never going out to play cards. We stopped our elders earlier.\nTherefore, before the outbreak, they began to pay more attention, and we also started to hoard some masks, alcohol and 84 disinfectant very early.\nIn fact, gossip spread faster than official news. We received a lot of gossip, including WeChat official accounts and messages between friends. At that time, we desperately sent it to our elders.\nI thought we were experiencing a history, and this year is definitely a history.\nEven when SARS happened, it was said lockdown of city, but it did not really happen.\nBut now, Wuhan was firmly locked down, and not only Wuhan was locked down, but the whole Hubei Province was locked down, so what we have experienced must be history, and in this historical event, we have lost our loved ones and experienced these dangers. In this tense time, as a person, I thought we should not forget this matter.\nAmong my relatives, friends, classmates and people I know, there were infected and diagnosed people in almost every family.\nI was very closed to my grandma.\nShe has been sent to dialysis by me every week for the past 3 years.\nFrankly, if you haven't seen it, when you see the dialysis room for the first time, the impact was very big. It was the feeling that people's blood is pumped out of the body, passed through the machine and then inject into it. There is a feeling that people are separated alive, and then washed and stuffed into it.\nBut there was no way for this conventional treatment to continue now.\nIn this process, the focus that everyone always saw was the main body. In fact, there were many people under the shadow of cracks. In fact, there were not a few of these people. If you counted the number of them, it was really too many.\n(Editor's Note: 8 hours after the interview ended on the afternoon of February 5, Lu Fan told “Portrait” on WeChat: My grandmother just passed away, thank you for your attention.\nIt should be useful with the media's attention and online help. The District Health Commission told us at night that the hospitalization list had been opened, but grandma couldn't wait. )\n\n2\nThe following is Zhang Qiong's self-statement. Her mother Wei Ruzhen was unable to continue dialysis in the original hospital because of chronic pneumonia.\nMy mother is 79 years old in this year and has uremia and various basic diseases. She has been undergoing kidney dialysis for a long time, 3 times a week.\nShe had been doing dialysis in Wuhan Tianyou Hospital before. After this hospital was collected as the 3rd batch of designated fever hospital, the dialysis room was closed, and my mother was transferred to Huangjiahu Branch of Wuhan University of Science and Technology Affiliated Hospital for dialysis.\nWhen we got there, the hospital asked us to take CT and take blood tests. After doing it, we found that my mother's lungs were inflamed.\nShe did have chronic pneumonia in her lungs, which happened when she was hospitalized for heart failure 3 years ago. At that time, the doctor said that every organ of her body was failing, so it was normal to have inflammation.\nHuangjiahu Hospital asked my mother to do nucleic acid identification, so we lined up at People's Hospital all night. My spouse and I lined up to let my mother rest in the car.\nThe result appeared as negative, so we took the result back to Huangjiahu Hospital and gave us dialysis that time (February 1).\nOn the February 4, we went to dialysis again, and the hospital asked us to take another film. CT showed no change compared with before, and asked us to do nucleic acid test. I had to take my mother to the doctor and ask them to diagnose as cough (the symptom that she didn’t have) for my mother, so that I could be qualified for nucleic acid test.\nWe did it twice that day, once in the No.7 Hospital and once in the People's Hospital, and the results were all negative.\nOn the February 5, we returned to Huangjiahu Hospital with the results. I said my mother would be dead without dialysis. They called the clinical laboratory of CT and then gave dialysis. When I made an appointment for the next time, the hospital said that it was absolutely impossible. As long as there was inflammation in the lungs, we would not accept.\nI called the hospital leaders, and they said they would have a meeting to study it. After more than two hours, a secretary called me and said that to be on the safe side, dialysis would not be given as long as there was pneumonia.\nMy mother didn't have fever, cough, shortness of breath, and has no symptoms (COVID-19).\nNo matter how many times you did the nucleic acid test, even all results were negative and you will not be accepted.\nHe didn't accept nucleic acid test now. He only looked at chest X-ray and didn't accept as long as there was inflammation.\nOn the morning of February 6, I ran dialysis rooms in several hospitals, there were some private hospitals and designated hospitals, I was pointed out everywhere. You went there to ask, you went there to ask, and when you asked the right place, they even didn't ask me what happened, so they just said that the hospital bed was full and they couldn’t accept.\nI was also very considerate of them. All nurses worked in 3 shifts, and they were still doing dialysis from 8: 00AM to 10: 00PM.\nI called the hotline of the mayor of Wuhan, the Municipal Health Commission and the District Health Commission. I called all the hotlines, and I ran away from the hospitals where I could run.\nEvery time the health commission calls, it says that they should report, and then it will be solved for you. The community’s response is the same as the hotline. Reply after reporting, then there would be no following.\nOn one time, the person who answered the phone of the Health Commission told me, \"Tell the hospital to study the ‘Notice on Doing a Good Job of Medical Security for Special Patients during the COVID-19 Outbreak’. “\nI was in distress situation. I am a citizen. I read the document to them. Now they simply ignore me. What's the point?\nMy mother has been suffering from diabetes for more than 20 years. Complications include coronary heart disease and uremia. All organs of her body are failing, including inflammation of her urinary tract and lung.\nRecently, she couldn't get dialysis in time. When the water in her body was much, her body swelled. After swelling, the water oppressed her heart, which made her heart uncomfortable.\nThere was water in the lungs.\nShe would continue to have inflammation.\nIf a patient like her couldn't get dialysis, it would last a week at most.\nSometimes I ate two dumplings a day, but I was not hungry, because I was really in a hurry, and I couldn’t eat anything.\nI couldn’t fall asleep at night.\nMy mother was very anxious, too. She said that I would stop dialysis, and she was afraid that we would be infected.\nI had to reassure her that I’ll try to find it. You'll be fine. There will always be a place to help you with dialysis.\nPatients with COVID-19 were very poor. They really needed treatment, but these dialysis patients are human beings and \n(Editor's Note: On February 8, Zhang Qiong found a private hemodialysis center in Hanyang to dialysis her mother at her own expense. \"I am grateful to have a place to give her dialysis,\" she said.\nThe frequency of dialysis was reduced to twice a week, and she told her mother to try to control water intake.\nWhat Zhang Qiong is praying now is that they will not be rejected by this private hemodialysis center on Thursday, February 13.)\n3\n\nThe following is Dong Xue's self-statement.\nShe is a 25-year-old girl born and raised in Wuhan.\nHer father suffered from lung inflammation, and at the same time, the kidney transplanted for 9 months showed rejection reaction, and died without any intubation.\nMy father, aged 51, had a kidney transplant in Tongji Hospital, Hankou 9 months ago. After that, his condition recovered well, which was higher than the average of ordinary kidney transplantation in the same period.\nBut there was something wrong with his lungs. One was that the previous dialysis caused hydrops due to improper operation. At that time, about 0.5 kilogram of blood was pumped out.\nDuring kidney transplantation, the lung produced nodules again, and there has been a root cause of the lung since then.\nOn January 15, my father started to have a fever and took antipyretics. On January 18, he went to the hospital. The respiratory department of Tongji Hospital in Hankou ruled out the possibility of COVID-19. The kidney transplant doctor suggested that we should go to hospital for emergency injection to suppress pneumonia.\nWe also got the hospitalization certificate, but at the same time, the control of the epidemic situation in Wuhan began to tighten. The hospital said that my father had inflammation in the lungs and could not be accepted. Asked us to go home and take medicine for our own treatment, and wait until the epidemic situation stabilizes before being hospitalized.\nAfter that, we contacted Tongji Hospital all the time and wanted to be hospitalized. Without success, we just asked us to take IV, and we went to the community hospital for IV.\nWhile treating pneumonia, we also stopped anti-rejection drugs according to the doctor's advice, because anti-rejection drugs, contrary to antibiotics for treating pneumonia, reduce human immunity.\nOn the morning of February 1, my father had kidney rejection, and almost no urine, with the highest fever reaching 41 degrees and creatinine rising from 83 to 280.\nAfter calling 120, they couldn't come. If we went to the hospital, we must go to the fever clinic for examination. We were afraid of being cross-infected, so we went home and contacted the community. They said that we could only be screened whether it is COVID-19 virus infection, and we couldn't do any kidney function related examination because of fever.\nOn the next day, because the situation was really urgent, we went to Optics Valley Tongji Hospital to have a nucleic acid test. I hoped that if we can confirm the diagnosis, we can go to a designated hospital for treatment. If it is negative, we can also go to a general hospital for treatment.\nOn that day, my father spent a whole day on IV in Optics Valley Tongji Hospital, including doing various examinations, and stayed in the hospital for more than 10 hours.\nThe result showed negative.\nMy mother stayed in Optics Valley Tongji Hospital for 10 hours and didn't see any doctors.\nBecause the medical personnel were busy dealing with COVID-19, they were overloaded and had no time to help my mother, and there were no doctors with relevant experience on duty in the hospital.\nI heard that many COVID-19 patients with negative nucleic acid test were found clinically, which infected nurses and doctors. Therefore, my father now had neither a confirmed diagnosis nor a complete exclusion. We cannot go to either hospital. Even if we were looking for directions, we didn't know which direction to work hard.\nIn fact, we also asked respiratory experts in 2 or 3 big hospitals. They looked at my dad's CT trend in the past 20 days, and no doctor said it was like COVID-19.\nIt was not COVID-19, but we couldn't find a hospital.\nMy mother ran several non-designated hospitals these days, thinking about intubation first (before dialysis, patients with kidney disease need to be intubated at the vein to draw blood out of the body and transport it back to the body), and then once there was any situation, she could go to dialysis in time to save her life.\nHowever, those non-designated hospitals, either the departments are closed, the smaller ones have no beds, and the smaller ones have no ability and conditions.\nMy father should go back to Tongji Hospital, Hankou, the first hospital in this special situation. I also understand that it is in the epidemic center, and it is really incapable of treating my father.\nIn Optics Valley Tongji Hospital, we also met a very enthusiastic young doctor before, saying that if our nucleic acid test results showed negative, they would be fine.\nAfter the results come out, (pause), for various reasons, I may not know what the reason is, but it just goes away anyway.\nHe couldn’t help us.\nAt that time, I knew it was useless to send Weibo, but I hoped to let everyone know this matter as much as possible, see if it could be seen by relevant people one day, and then help this group of people.\nI had a fever on the 28th day of Chinese New Year. I spent 10 hours in the Army General Hospital and had a CT scan. My lungs were slightly infected, and now it has basically improved.\nBut the doctor advised me to quarantine myself, so I lived in another house of our family, and only my mother drove my dad to the hospital every day.\nI could only get to know the situation of my parents through WeChat every day.\nMy dad asked me not to go to hospital and visit him.\nOur family used to have pets, so there was a camera in the living room, and I watched my father lie on the sofa every day.\nThey go out to the hospital at 8 o'clock every morning and come back at 11 o'clock at night at the latest.\nI dared not to call them, because taking out cell phones in the hospital would increase the risk of infection.\nJust look at the camera, when watching them to arrive home, wash their hands and disinfect them, and then I dared to call them.\nI was afraid they were too anxious to answer the phone and forget to wash their hands.\nIn fact, if it wasn't during the epidemic, if my dad went to the hospital for dialysis and treatment in time, the kidneys and people could be insured, but now in this situation, there was no way to guarantee dialysis, and the tube couldn't be inserted, so there was no way.\nMy father had chronic nephritis since I could remember something, and then it got worse step by step until he had a kidney transplant last year.\nMy father always wanted to buy a house in Hainan, and lived in winter. Wuhan is too cold in winter, which is not suitable for patients like him.\nLast year, my grandmother died on Chinese New Year's Eve, and we couldn't go back to my father's hometown Xiaogan. This year, because of his illness, we couldn't go back to Xiaogan either.\nI won't catch a cold next year. My dad can realize his dream of wintering in Hainan. I believe so.\n(Editor's Note: On the evening of February 4, Dong Xue's parents came home near midnight and found no place to intubate.\nShe couldn't quarantine herself anymore, so she decided to let her friend drive her home the next day, fearing that she would blame herself in the future.\nHer premonition unfortunately came true, and her father died in the early morning of the February 6. )\n(To protect the privacy of interviewees, Fang Hui, Lu Fan and Dong Xue are pseudonyms)\n\n", "English title": "\"Deleted\" Wuhan kidney disease patients under the cracks", "原文標題": "【删除】夹缝下的武汉肾病患者"}, {"slug": "963", "English content": "", "English title": "\"Editorial\" Leishenshan hospital closed the temporary treatment centers: born in response to the epidemic, mission accomplished", "原文標題": "【社论】雷神山休舱：应劫而生，功成身退"}, {"slug": "964", "English content": "Original title: Changde a farmer donated 15,000 surgical masks: was not right to take these masks ar", "English title": "\"A grain of sand in the times\" A farmer in Changde donated 15,000 medical masks.

While many large hospitals did not even let reporters in, Zhongnan Hospital opened its doors to all reporters. I interviewed more than ten people, including the director, doctors, and nurses. They all opened their hearts and told me about the real situation without reservation.\n    Zhongnan Hospital was a hospital that possessed valuable human resources. Under the leadership of a group of skilled doctors, Zhongnan Hospital started the wartime mobilization on January 3 in the encounter battle against the virus, and established fever clinics and isolation wards in accordance with the strictest guidelines of SARS prevention. During the attrition war against the virus, they took charge of the seventh designated hospital and the Wuhan Living Room Hospital, the largest Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan. During the decisive phase of the battle, they were in charge of the Leishenshan Hospital, fighting against the virus with perseverance and professionalism, and they are still staying at Leishenshan Hospital to treat the last dozens of patients. Zhongnan Hospital, which only counts as a medium-sized hospital among all the hospitals in Wuhan, has took on the most work in the fight against the virus, providing 5,400 beds for coronavirus patients at the peak of the epidemic.\n    Wang Xinghuan, the director of Zhongnan Hospital, is a bit of a maverick. He is a top urologist in China and has just won the second prize of the State Technological Invention Award in 2019. In Guangzhou, 2003, Wang Xinghuan was on the front line of the fight against SARS. He could never forget about the experience and had since kept his notes detailing the timeline of the epidemic in his computer. On January 10, sensing the severity of the situation, he sent his SARS notes to many provincial and municipal leaders to remind them not to forget the painful lessons of SARS.

Sun Ping (pseudonym) made them for herself. She was the first-line medical care of an First-class Hospital at Grade 3 in Wuhan. \"To fight this virus, it depends on immunity and we must eat well.\"\nAfter lunch, she rode an electric scooter to go to work in the hospital. After traffic control, it was her most effective means of transportation.\nA shift would last for 7 hours. \"I don't drink or eat during shift, and I even don't go to the toilet.\"\nOn the one hand, it was very busy, the more important thing was that protective clothing and N95 masks were distributed in limited quantities.\nWearing a mask for a long time, her face was pressed with a deep scar. \"The rope is tied to the ear, like a knife.\"\nBut this is also a kind of \"happiness\"- only the medical N95 with extremely strict protection can produce such an effect. \"N95 can only be worn by the medical personnel who need to directly contact patients, and only one mask is distributed per day.\"\nThe hospital provided a dormitory for the first-line medical care personnel. Sun Ping lived for two days and couldn't stand it. Their hospital is a typical small First-class Hospital at Grade 3, and there are more than 1,000 people in administrative logistics. \"Now about 20% personnel in all departments fallen ill. There are several suspended patients in our department.\"\nLiving in the dormitory, she didn't dare to take off her mask when she slept. \"Because you don't know who might be “infected”, many people are now asymptomatic.\"\nSome colleagues temporarily had no symptoms, but because of the doctor's self-examination, they felt that they had been infected and \"feel uneasy\", they continuously took lung CT for 3 days in a row, which showed that \"it was normal for the first two days, and on the third day, the lungs showed that there was something really wrong.\nIs it terror or not? \"\nLung CT is a highly accurate test method when there is no condition to take a test for diagnosis.\nShe lived apart from her family very early, and the girl persuaded her not to go to work again. \"Mom, don't go to work!\nAren’t you afraid?\nEven if resigning will confiscate your professional qualification certificate, our family has money to live, and soon I can work and support our family. \"\nSun Ping cried. \"Of course I'm afraid. How can I not be afraid?\nPeople around me fell down successively, I don't know if our small hospital can hold up. \"\n\"I want to tell the real situation that I have seen and known. I don't want to create panic. I don't want to chase anyone's responsibility. I just want ordinary people to know the real situation, and all parts of the country can pay attention to it from top to bottom.\".\nShe also opened all the WeChat friends circle to me. On October 1, the National Day of 2019, the family went out to travel. She smiled brightly in the photo. \"Before the epidemic, my life was very happy.\"\nBesides the happy family, she also has a harmonious and friendly department environment. \"The atmosphere of our department is one of the best in the hospital.\"\nWhen seeing Lu Xiaohong with real name, the director of Wuhan Fifth Hospital, telling the media about the personal observation of Wuhan epidemic hiding, she praised her colleague's integrity and courage.\n\"The secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee said that ‘Huanggang must not be turned into the second Wuhan' and hopes that other cities will not repeat the tragedy of Wuhan!\"\nDressed neatly and closed her door, she shouted on WeChat, \"I go to work!\nMy protection is absolutely professional, don’t worry!\nWrite all my words down: just says that the frontline medical care in Wuhan can persist in working for a while. The ordinary people who are locked at home should not worry about going to work first. Let's persist and get back our happy life. \"\nSun Ping’s oral statement:\n1. At the end of December and early January, we found that this virus was completely different from before. At that time, we called it \"virus lung.\"\nAt the end of December, 2019, we saw a \"white lung\" dynamic CT transmitted from a large comprehensive First-class Hospital at Grade 3, and all the patients' lungs were eroded by viruses.\nTen-second video made people scared.\nI asked our hospital's professional lung CT diagnostician, whether this would be a viral cold or other diseases.\n\"It's completely different, and nothing else will be as full and diffuse as this.\"\nHe answered for sure.\nAt that time, some people thought it was \"suspected SARS\". Everyone was very sensitive and immediately put on standard protection-masks, hats and gloves.\nAround December 30, it was reported at that time that \"the unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan has been quarantined and the results will be announced as soon as possible\", and we paid special attention to it, waiting for the confirmation notice from the top.\nWithin a few days, the hospital organized training, and the notice said \"viral pneumonia of unknown origin\", which was later referred to as \"viral lung\".\nAll departments were required to attend, the training materials were kept strictly confidential, and the notice said that those who take photos and rumor have serious consequences should be held accountable.\nAt the beginning of January, there were suspected patients in various hospitals. Some small hospitals did not accept fever patients and pushed them to other hospitals.\nThis situation was jointly reported to Wuhan Health Commission by several other hospitals, and the notice was issued from top, saying that the patients admitted to each hospital must be treated by themselves, blocking the opening of referral.\nAs Director Lu Xiaohong of Wuhan No.5 Hospital said, most hospitals were not infectious disease hospitals and did not have quarantined conditions.\nOnly the quarantined ward can be vacated urgently, and the respiratory medicine department, emergency department, fever clinic and intensive care unit of our hospital should be integrated to deal with it.\nAt that time, there was already a feeling of fighting hard. I believed all hospitals were prepared, but there was no announcement or reminder.\nAccording to the regulations on the management of infectious diseases, hospitals did not have the authority to report suspected cases, and they must obey Wuhan Health Commission when releasing them.\nAt that time, the top asked us that all specimens were not allowed to be sent out. At that time, there was no special \"virus lung\" nucleic acid test reagent, and we could only rule out one by one whether it was caused by other known viruses. If not, the results, together with the lung CT diagnosis made by the first diagnosis of radiology department, were determined as \"virus lung suspected\".\n2、\n2. In mid-January, \"patchy infection lesions\" became a customary description among doctors, and medical staff were infected, but the hospital had no right to raise the protection level\nIn mid-January, our all departments had already entered a state of high tension, and at that time, it was heard that some suspected patients in hospitals had died.\nThe emergency department of every hospital was crowded with people, and the communication between hospitals was not good.\nAt that time, it was not allowed to write \"viral pneumonia\" in the medical certificate, but some hospitals wrote \"patchy infection lesions\". All hospitals were communicated, and many of similar cases were written according to this. If doctors saw that the patients coming to see a doctor with the initial diagnosis opinion of \"multiple patchy infection lesions in both lungs\" (equivalent to highly suspected), they basically understood what this means and know how to deal with it.\nThe medical personnel in the fever ward had put on protective clothing conditionally.\nHowever, the protection level of the whole hospital had not been uniformly adjusted, and only when it reached the third level of protection, the medical personnel could be protected from infection to a greater extent.\nHowever, from January 6 to January 10, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission did not issue a circular on \"unknown pneumonia\".\nThe notification that we have received from the Health Commission was on January 5: \"There were 59 patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unknown cause, and no clear evidence of human-to-human infection was found, and no medical personnel were found to be infected.\"\nAt that time, no hospital in Wuhan was able to rise the protection level without authorization. During this period, it was also the time when medical personnel were most infected, and several colleagues in our hospital were infected.\nThe most deplorable thing was that the infection of more than a dozen medical personnel caused by the patient in Concord Neurosurgery.\nIn fact, during the operation on the night of January 7, doctors told each other to take care of the virus lung. However, at that time, the notification from the Health Commission was \"no clear evidence of human-to-human infection\", and the patient did not have any respiratory symptoms, so he had to operate according to the hospital's routine operation protection requirements.\nAt last, this patient became ill. On January 15th, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, and the medical personnel were wronged because there was no \"negligence\" as mentioned by the outside world, and all the protection that could be done (at that time) had been done to the best.\nIn the announcement issued by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 16th, there was still no mention of the infection of medical personnel.\nLike many medical personnel in other hospitals, I didn't know about this until the January 20. We all said that if Academician Zhong Nanshan hadn't told us about this, the doctors wouldn't know how many people would be dumped.\nEven the front-line didn’t know anything, ordinary people didn't know the danger of ambush around them.\nOn January 18, it was the small Chinese New Year, people in Wuhan still attached great importance to this festival. Friends and family would have dinner together. The subway was full of people, and none of them wore masks.\nThe unit ordered us not to spread, but in fact, I had been reminding my neighbors to pay attention to this matter in the owners' group of our community. I believed I was definitely not the only one among the medical personnel doing this, but it is too small to rely on personal strength.\nWe also dare not publish on the Internet, for fear of being labeled as \"spreading rumors\" and \"creating panic\".\nOn January 20, Academician Zhong said in an interview with Bai Yansong that \"it is certain that the human-to-human infection\", which made people pay more attention to it.\nWe are in the front line, and we have seen clearly before that this virus is contagious.\nThere were 3 patients in a ward, and there was no communication with each other. All 3 were viral lungs.\nThere was also a young man, who is very handsome. He said that the local media reports were so understated that he continued to work after being infected. As a result, he infected everyone in the same office.\nI lived separately from my family at that time.\nIt was the saddest day for me, and I felt oppressed.\nAs a medical staff, I must obey discipline.\nBut I didn't know why we can't say anything.\n\n3. Since January 23, after the lockdown of the city, the hospital has been surrounded by swarming patients, and the treatment was under great pressure\nAfter Academician Zhong issued an early warning, many citizens rushed into the hospital and asked for examination.\nHave you seen the video of the crowded fever clinic in Wuhan Union Hospital on January 23?\nAlthough 7 new hospitals were added to treat fever patients in an emergency on the January 22, and then 2 batches were added in succession, hoping to achieve special treatment for diseases, the epidemic spread because of the loss of control in the early stage, and the idea of special treatment could not be realized at all.\nFrom January 23, when the city was locked down, to January 26, when the traffic control started at 0: 00, there were at least 5 or 6 hundred people doing CT every day in our hospital, and there was no way to maintain the scene order.\nThere are a little fewer people in the past 2 days, and there were almost 200 suspected cases in one day. Our whole hospital has only 200 beds in quarantine ward, and now the general departments are basically closed, and we are fully dealing with fever.\nDo you think this situation is urgent or not?\nOther hospitals were similar, so you only needed to see how difficult it is to be hospitalized.\nAll relatives and friends were asking for help, but if you want to be hospitalized at this time, to be honest, even the hospital leadership couldn’t solve the problem.\nI have been doctor for so many years, and my heart has not hardened.\nYesterday, I saw the old couple, whose children were not around, and came to the hospital trembling. The filming situation was very bad, but there was no bed, so they had to go home.\nHow could we do?\nI didn't know, I could only tell them how to quarantine when they go back home.\nWhat a pity, this disease was a great test for the old and weak.\nI didn't want to cause panic, but we must let everyone know that this virus is not as deadly as SARS, and the progress of clinical treatment is not so fast, but the infection speed is only strong or weak.\nYou may not get sick, but you may also be a very poisonous source of infection.\nBetween hospitals and peers, they have a meeting to study together, or a professional, and there are large groups across hospitals. I heard that there is a large group of radiology departments in the whole province. In recent more than a month, no one dared to speak, probably not knowing what to say.\nRadiology Department is so critical.\nAfter the media propaganda, the common people recognized the diagnosis by nucleic acid reagent test. In fact, as everyone knows in hospitals, lung CT is very telling. As long as lung film shows \"highly suspected\", the proportion of diagnosis by nucleic acid test is very high.\nThe medical personnel in our hospital also took X-ray. If they were suspected, they would start treatment directly, quarantine early, treat early and recover early. The front line was short of manpower. It was too slow to appoint testing institutions and queue up for nucleic acid testing. The time of front-line medical personnel couldn't afford to delay.\nIn the past two days, the voices of front-line doctors and nurses came out one after another, and there were more reports on TV, and various business groups were a little active.\nThe protection level of our hospital has been upgraded to three levels, so people must be fully informed of the spread, risk and pathogenicity of the epidemic.\nThese were the whole process from discovery to spread of the epidemic as I know it. Of course, they were only observations in a small area where I live, but I think it can also explain many problems.\nI don't complain to anyone, I don't want to blame anyone, and I don't want people to panic.\nNow the country attaches great importance to it, and all parties give full support to it, so we must persist in carrying it down no matter how difficult it is in the front line.\nI don't know if I can bear it all the time. I hope people in other cities don't pay such a high price like Wuhan.\n(In order to protect the privacy of respondents, Sun Ping is assumed as an alias.\nHere, I would also like to thank all the front-line doctors and nurses who have been interviewed by this journal and delivered the truth to readers. )\n\n", "English title": "Exclusive in-depth interview: from discovery to closure, why does the epidemic break out in Wuhan- from the first-line medical personnel (the original text was delected)", "原文標題": "独家深访：从发现到封城，武汉一线医护复盘疫情为何爆发  (原文被刪)"}, {"slug": "2378", "English content": "New data through fiscal first-line Private Lesson Index Promotion Conference enterprise users to dow", "English title": "Exclusive Shi Zhengli responds to query, experts agree that the Covid-19 virus is not man-made_ Caixin.com", "原文標題": "独家石正丽回应质疑 专家一致认为新冠病毒非人造_财新网_财新网"}, {"slug": "2380", "English content": "Exclusive Interview Ho: the epidemic is still in the early days, the world should follow the example", "English title": "Exclusive Interview with He Dayi: the epidemic is still in its early stage, and the world should follow the \"Wuhan style isolation\" mode", "原文標題": "独家专访何大一：疫情尚在早期，全球应仿效“武汉式隔离”"}, {"slug": "2382", "English content": "Hong readers to: new crown epidemic, the Chinese at home and abroad Face of anxiety, anger and hope\n", "English title": "Readers' letters: Anxiety, anger and hope of Chinese and overseas Chinese in covid-19", "原文標題": "读者来鸿：新冠疫情中海内外华人的焦虑、愤怒与希望"}, {"slug": "2383", "English content": "2019 global epidemic coronavirus epidemic depth observation\nSite: Why New York became \"the US versio", "English title": "On the spot: Why did New York become the \"American version of Wuhan\"?", "原文標題": "端传媒 现场：纽约为什么变成了“美国版的武汉”？"}, {"slug": "2384", "English content": "", "English title": "Oral report of Chinese CDC personnel: 90% People are idle, 10% People are working for not knowing what they should do", "原文標題": "端传媒 中国疾控人员口述：90_的人闲着，10_的人干活，还不知道要干啥"}, {"slug": "2385", "English content": "Duan Cheng Academy of Sciences, died of illness in Wuhan\nSurging News\n News reporters Deng surging Y", "English title": "Duan Zhengcheng, academician, died of illness in Wuhan", "原文標題": "段正澄院士，因病在武汉去世"}, {"slug": "2386", "English content": "Off drugs crisis: HIV-infected persons after the closed city seal Village\nOriginal characters report", "English title": "Drug crisis: people infected with HIV after the closure of cities and villages", "原文標題": "断药危机：封城封村之后的艾滋感染者"}, {"slug": "2390", "English content": "Dialogue | zoomed Lee ADVANCED former Italian official to talk about the epidemic: the government is", "English title": "Dialogue Talk to former Italian officials about epidemic situation: government response is too slow but all medical staff are heroes", "原文標題": "对话 意大利前高官谈疫情：政府应对太慢，医护人员是英雄"}, {"slug": "2391", "English content": "Dialogue \"transfer rumors\" were admonished Doctor: I was to draw attention to prevention\nBeijing New", "English title": "Dialogue 2: Doctor warned for \"spreading rumors\": I'm just try to tell everyone to take precautions", "原文標題": "对话“传谣”被训诫医生：我是在提醒大家注意防范"}, {"slug": "2394", "English content": "Chinese students studying abroad dialogue, their stories during the epidemic\nThing outside Beijing N", "English title": "Talk to Chinese students studying abroad about their stories during the epidemic", "原文標題": "对话海外求学的中国留学生，疫情期间他们的故事"}, {"slug": "2396", "English content": "Dialogue fellow chicken: tear the letter, and the expansion of a $ 200 conference\nOriginal Wei Shi J", "English title": "Dialogue with fellow countryman: tearing letter, expansion and a 200 yuan press conference", "原文標題": "对话老乡鸡：撕信，扩张和一场200元的发布会"}, {"slug": "2397", "English content": "American epidemiologists flow ⾏ dialogue: new crown infection was found on what we mean\nWhy?\n mp.wei", "English title": "Conversations with U.S. Epidemiologists: What does undetected Covid-19 mean for us?", "原文標題": "对话美国流行病学家：未发现的新冠感染者对我们意味着什么？"}, {"slug": "2399", "English content": "The first support dialogue Wuhan Central Hospital medical team captain: how we do health care zero i", "English title": "Dialogue with the leaders of the first batch of medical teams supporting Wuhan Central Hospital: how can we achieve zero infection for doctors and nurses", "原文標題": "对话首批支援武汉中心医院医疗队队长：我们如何做到医护零感染"}, {"slug": "2400", "English content": "Wu dialogue: the state has decided to help businesses weather the storm, I hope I can save more appe", "English title": "Dialogue with Wu Hai: the state has decided to help enterprises tide over the difficulties.

The virus nucleic acid test, which has always been the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis in COVID-19, has a false negative situation in practice.\nXu Shunqing, deputy dean of the School of Public Health, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, said at a press conference in Hubei Province on the evening of February 9 that COVID-19 mainly invaded the lungs, so there was a certain false negative in nucleic acid test, namely, some patients were not detected, that is, missed diagnosis, which may cause some infection sources not really identified, and there was a risk of expansion.\nBut at the same time, it is very important for the epidemic which is still in the high incidence period to screen out the confirmed patients in the shortest time and then treat them centrally.\nAt present, nucleic acid test still plays a very important role in the process of diagnosis.\nLi Taisheng, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, who participated in the prevention and control of SARS in 2003, said in an interview with The Paper that COVID-19 could be diagnosed as soon as possible through nucleic acid test, which was a more favorable condition compared with the prevention and control in 2003.\nAt the same time, with the adjustment of the national diagnosis and treatment scheme and the attention of many medical experts, the loopholes brought by false negatives in nucleic acid test are shrinking.\n\"After this problem was discovered, the National Health Commission tried the 5th edition of COVID-19's diagnosis and treatment plan and began to use CT and clinic as the basis. Now the judgment of the condition is not only the emergence of positive nucleic acid test, but also the clinical standard. There is no fever for 3 consecutive days. CT imaging has improved, and these 3 aspects are combined.\"\nXu Shunqing said on the evening of February 9.\nAt noon on the February 11, Wu Juan told The Paper, and father had already been admitted to the centralized isolation point in Qingshan District of Wuhan on the February 10.\nThey were still waiting for the results of father's second nucleic acid test.\nBecause of the limited medical conditions at the isolation point, father still had to go to Wuhan No.9 Hospital for injections every day after living in the isolation point.\nA \"door\" that must be passed for diagnosis\nWu Juan didn't realize the seriousness of the epidemic until Wuhan’s “lockdown”.\nBut she never imagined that the haze of the epidemic would come to her family.\nOn January 26, the 2nd day of the lunar month, Wu Juan's father started to have symptoms such as soreness in the waist, fatigue and cough.\nAt this time, only 3 days have passed since Wuhan’s \"lockedown\".\nIn order to help father buy anti-inflammatory drugs, Wu Juan went to pharmacies near home, but she couldn't buy them, and even Oseltamivir for treating influenza was sold out.\nIn desperation, she had to buy 10 boxes of kid Oseltamivir for her 71-year-old father.\nAt this time, father was still very stubborn.\nHe always thought that his symptoms were caused by falling asleep when he opened the window to breathe.\nUntil February 3, father didn't take any medicine, and his physical discomfort became more and more serious.\nOn the morning of February 4, father was too tired to get up, his face turned red, and his body temperature was measured to be 37.4°C. After going to a community outpatient clinic in Qingshan District for routine blood test, it was found that the ratio of white blood cells and lymphocytes was low, accompanied by fever, so the community hospital suggested that he be sent to CR & WISCO General Hospital for CT examination.\nOn the same day, the CT diagnosis result was infectious disease of both lungs. The doctor thought it was viral pneumonia and prescribed Oseltamivir and Lianhua Qingwen Granule. He was advised to go home and observe in isolation. If the fever was above 38.5°C, he would go to the hospital again.\nDespite the diagnosis results of CT examination, according to the \"Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Pneumonia Infected with COVID-19 (Trial Fourth Edition)\" issued by the National Health Commission at that time, the confirmed cases should have \"real-time fluorescent RT-PCR detection of COIVD-19 nucleic acid positive in respiratory tract samples or blood samples\". Simply speaking, the nucleic acid test results are positive.\nThis has become a \"gate” that Wu Juan's father must open for whether to be diagnosed.\nDoubt of \"False Negative\"\nOn the evening of February 4, Wu Juan's father had a high fever of 39°C.\nWu Juan hurriedly sent his father to CR & WISCO General Hospital for medical treatment. Although the hospital was not a designated hospital, it was relatively close to home.\nThe doctor prescribed medicine for 10 days, and he could only give infusion in outpatient clinic.\nFortunately, in the evening, the doctor told me that he could come to the hospital for nucleic acid test early the next morning, and Wu Juan felt that there would be hope again.\nHowever, the next day, when they arrived at CR & WISCO General Hospital on time, the fever clinic doctor said that there were only 20 nucleic acid test reagents on that day, and there was no name of Wu Juan's father on the registration list. The reagents on that day had been used up, so they had to wait another day before going to the hospital for detection.\nBecause of repeated fever, Wu Juan's father was unable to stand, so he had to squat down in the corridor of the hospital to rest.\nWu Juan said that on the same day, a leader went to CR & WISCO General Hospital to inspect the epidemic prevention and control work. When watching her father crouching in the hospital corridor, the leader went forward to know the situation, and then arranged for the elderly to take the \"green channel\", finally achieving the key step of diagnosis - nucleic acid test.\nOnly when the nucleic acid test is positive her father would be confirmed, and it is possible and qualified for her father to be hospitalized.\n“But, what if it’s not positive?”\nWu Juan is still worried about that.\nIn fact, her worries have reason.\nThe problem of false negative test of COVID-19 virus nucleic acid has surfaced one after another.\nOn the evening of February 5, Wang Chen, vice president of Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, told CCTV “News 1+1” that not all patients could detect nucleic acid positive, but only 30% to 50% of patients with COVID-19 infection were positive.\nThere are still many false negatives by collecting throat swabs of suspected cases.\nOn the evening of February 6, Li Wenliang of Central Hospital of Wuhan Eye Hospital, which attracted the attention of the whole network, was critically ill and died after several hours of rescue.\nAccording to the Weibo released by Li Wenliang before his death, he was officially diagnosed after 3 nucleic acid tests, and the results of the first 2 nucleic acid tests were negative.\nAt noon on February 7, the results of Wu Juan's father's first nucleic acid test were released, which showed negative.\nBut at this time, father still had a high fever, and his consciousness was somewhat blurred.\nIn the afternoon, her father went to CR & WISCO General Hospital again for blood routine examination and CT examination. The CT imaging diagnosis was more serious than the first one.\nThe doctor suggested that Wu Juan's father go to No.9 Hospital for reexamination, because CR & WISCO General Hospital was not a designated hospital, so COVID-19 could not be judged as false negative, and gave her a notice of transfer.\nOn the morning of February 8, Wu Juan's father went to Wuhan No.9 Hospital and showed the doctor the test results before, but he had to wait for transfusion in the outpatient department first.\nThe community was still making efforts.\nOn the morning of February 9, after receiving the telephone notification from the community workers, Wu Juan took her father to the No.9 Hospital for the second nucleic acid test, and the results could be obtained in about 2 to 3 days.\nShe said that she even expected her father's nucleic acid test to be positive, so that she could be hospitalized as soon as possible.\nZhou Xin, head of the first expert group supporting Hubei Medical Team from Shanghai, also said in an interview with The Paper that false negatives also involve many aspects, including differences in respiratory sensitivity of different people, differences in sampling methods and differences in production of different kit companies, which may cause false negatives for various reasons.\nThe \"supplementary plan\" is coming\nThe appearance of false negative in nucleic acid test also made fine-tuning the diagnosis and treatment scheme for COVID-19.\nAfter the outbreak, the National Plan for “Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Infected with COVID-19” was continuously updated, and the 5th edition was released by February 5.\nIn case diagnosis, this version of the diagnosis and treatment plan treats Hubei Province differently from other provinces except Hubei Province.\nOther provinces outside Hubei Province are still divided into \"suspected cases\" and \"confirmed cases\".\nHowever, Hubei Province added with the classification of \"clinical diagnosis\".\nThe standard of \"suspected case\" has modified to be considered as a suspected case, regardless of epidemiological history, as long as it meets the 2 clinical manifestations of \"fever and/or respiratory symptoms\" and \"normal or decreased white blood cell count or decreased lymphocyte count in early onset\".\nIt’s equivalent to the standard of suspected cases has been relaxed.\nSuspected cases with imaging features of pneumonia are clinically diagnosed cases.\nThe diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases have not changed.\nThe problem of missed diagnosis caused by false negative nucleic acid test is also attracting the attention of experts.\nOn the evening of February 9, at the press conference held in Hubei, Xu Shunqing, deputy dean of School of Public Health, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, said that the part invaded by COVID-19 was mainly the lungs, so there was a certain false negative in nucleic acid test, that is, some patients were not detected, which was missed diagnosis, which may cause some infection sources not really identified, and there was a risk of expansion.\nXu Shunqing believed that after this problem was discovered, the 5th edition of the trial diagnosis and treatment plan took clinical symptoms such as CT detection as the basis. Now, the judgment of the disease was not only the appearance of nucleic acid test, but also clinical standards. There was no fever for 3 consecutive days, and CT imaging has improved. These three aspects were combined.\nLi Qing, a local person in Wuhan, is the beneficiary of the 5th edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan.\nOn February 3, Li Qing's parents-in-law and grandmother went to the Tongji Hospital affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology for nucleic acid testing. The results showed that the mother-in-law and grandmother were positive for nucleic acid, and they were hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19.\nHowever, the results of CT showed that the father-in-law had the most serious lung infection among the 3, and it spread, but the results of nucleic acid test were negative, so the doctor asked him to queue up again for nucleic acid test.\nLi Qing told The Paper that her father-in-law got the opportunity of hospitalization on February 7, judging by the clinical diagnosis standard because of the serious infection symptoms.\nFor patients with COVID-19 in Hubei Province, if there are no serious symptoms, in order to reduce the risk of infection, the 5th edition of the trial diagnosis and treatment plan requires the medical personnel at all levels and all kinds of medical institutions to find suspected diseases and clinical diagnosis cases that meet the case definition, and then carry out isolation treatment immediately.\nSuspected cases and clinically diagnosed cases should be isolated in a single room, and specimens should be collected for pathogen detection as soon as possible.\nDischarge standards are no longer single\nLiu Tong’s 70-year-old mother from Wuhan, was admitted to the isolation ward because the results of 2 nucleic acid tests were negative and could not be diagnosed, but she had certain symptoms of pulmonary infection.\nHis mother fell ill on January 23.\nAfter becoming a suspected case, Liu Tong's mother was isolated in the ward of Wuhan No.8 Hospital.\nFrom January 26 to now, she has finished 2 nucleic acid tests, and the hospital has not informed him of the results.\nHowever, the announcement of the hospital showed that it was negative if it was not notified within 48 hours, so he acquiesced that his mother's result was also negative.\nLiu Tong's mother's previous CT examination showed double lung infection.\nWhat worries him more was that, because she was not a confirmed patient, his mother lives in a six-person room instead of a single-room isolation ward, which was filled with people like his mother who cannot be diagnosed.\nLiu Tong was worried about whether there will be cross infection if there is false negative.\nFortunately, his mother's current physical condition tended to be stable, but the epidemic situation was still at a high incidence. Liu Tong cannot confirm whether mother can be discharged from hospital, and whether she is not a COVID-19 patient or contagious.\n\"I can only stay for a few more days.\"\nHe said.\nFor patients who have recovered from hospital, nucleic acid test was also a necessary procedure.\nThe trouble of false negative also exists.\nIn the trial of the 4th edition and the previous \"Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Pneumonia Infected with COVID-19\", the criteria for releasing isolation and discharge of patients with COVID-19 are that their body temperature has returned to normal for more than 3 days, their respiratory symptoms have obviously improved, and they have been tested negative for respiratory pathogen nucleic acid twice in a row (the sampling interval is at least 1 day), so they can be released from isolation and discharged or transferred to corresponding departments for treatment of other diseases according to their illness.\nIf 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests for infected people are false negative, it will affect the judgment of recovered patients.\nThe corresponding supplement appeared in the 5th edition of \"Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of Pneumonia Infected with COVID-19\".\nThe requirements of discharge standard are increased, and it is necessary to judge whether discharge is possible from 3 aspects: nucleic acid test, clinical symptoms and lung imaging.\nZhou Xin told The Paper that, generally speaking, patients who meet the nucleic acid test and are negative twice can be discharged safely.\nIt will be more scientific and safe to go home and quarantine for two weeks after discharge.\n\"To reduce false negatives, sampling should be accurate and the sampling method should be correct.\"\nZhou Xin said that the medical personnel for sampling should receive standardized training.\nThe sputum coughed by patients can be sampled, and the lavage fluid can also be used for nucleic acid detection. If the samples of deep respiratory tract can be obtained, its sensitivity and specificity are very high.\nFor most patients, it can be detected accurately.\n\nLi Taisheng, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, who participated in the prevention and control of SARS in 2003, said in an interview with The Paper that COVID-19 could be diagnosed as soon as possible through nucleic acid test, which was a more favorable condition compared with the prevention and control in 2003.\nWu Juan told The Paper that, on the morning of February 10, father was admitted to the centralized isolation point in Qingshan District, Wuhan.\nThey were still waiting for the results of father's second nucleic acid test.\n(Wu Juan, Li Qing and Liu Tong are pseudonyms, and intern Yan Caiqi also contributed to this article. )\nThis journal edited by Chang Chen\n", "English title": "The nucleic acid test was \"false negative\", the diagnosis and treatment plan was adjusted", "原文標題": "核酸检测“假阴性”，诊疗方案调整了"}, {"slug": "4306", "English content": "Holland said the team first discovered fully human monoclonal antibody for the prevention and treatm", "English title": "The Dutch team claims to find a human monoclonal antibody for the first time, which provides new possibilities for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19", "原文標題": "荷兰团队称首度发现全人源单克隆抗体，为防治新冠提供新可能"}, {"slug": "4307", "English content": "Dutch recall 600,000 masks imported from China, what happened?\nWang Qing interface News 1 week ago\nR", "English title": "What happened when the Netherlands recalled 600,000 masks imported from China?", "原文標題": "荷兰召回从中国进口的60万只口罩，发生了什么？"}, {"slug": "4310", "English content": "", "English title": "What is the difference between cases of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Hubei?

Merchant with surname of Wang who once sold aquatic products in the Seafood Wholesale Market at No.207 Development Avenue, Jianghan District, Wuhan said: \"Every time we go out and come back, we must disinfect our clothes with alcohol.\"\nSouth China Seafood Wholesale Market, was proved as the source of COVID-19.\nOn January 1, 2020, after the South China Seafood Wholesale Market was completely closed, the expert group conducted virus traceability research.\nAfter the market was closed, the above-mentioned merchant with surname of Wang, who still had hope of reopening the market, did not wait for the official survey results.\nAround January 8, seeing that the situation is getting more and more urgent, she gave the workers the holiday to go home in advance.\nUntil January 26, the official side announced the research progress.\nAccording to the China CDC, the expert group quarantined COVID-19 from South China Seafood Wholesale Market, proving that the virus originated from wild animals sold in South China Seafood Wholesale Market.\nAt present, the COVID-19, which started from South China Seafood Wholesale Market, has spread rapidly through the chain of wild animals infecting to human and human infecting to others.\nBy the time of being published, there have been more than 2,700 confirmed cases and more than 5,000 suspected cases.\nThe wild taste on the tip of the tongue has become a frightening \"poison\", and the largest seafood wholesale market in South China and its boss behind the scenes have aroused media attention for a while.\nSouth China Seafood Wholesale Market belongs to Wuhan South China Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"South China Group\"), a local enterprise in Wuhan, and is controlled by Yu's family.\nAt present, shareholders Yu Tian and Yu Qize each hold 50% of shares, and they are siblings.\nAccording to Netease Qingliu Studio, South China Group was founded by Yu Zhusheng (Yu Tian's father). At present, Yu Zhusheng has been about 60 years old and basically in retirement. The specific business of Yu’s family has been handed over to professional managers, and Yu’s family mainly focus on personnel and finance, of which Yu Tian is mainly responsible for finance.\nSouth China Group made its fortune mainly by purchasing land around Wuhan and Hubei rural areas, and then dabbled in warehousing and farmers' markets.\nAmong them, South China Seafood Wholesale Market was developed, constructed and operated by South China Group in 2011. It was once accused by public opinion of violent demolition and the use of triad forces because of the demolition of the project.\nChen Zhixiang, a key figure, always accompanied the expansion of the wealth map of Yu’s family , and the 2 parities also cooperated to open a pawn company to engage in usury business.\nChen Zhixiang has many connections with Wuhan state-owned assets system. Yu's family can also find contact with people in Hubei state-owned assets system.\nFame rises: real estate projects are accused of \"violent demolitions\"\nSouth China Group first started from Yu Zhusheng's contract team.\nAccording to China Business Journal, Yu Zhusheng was born in the village of Wuhan in 1962. He did not graduate from primary school and had a low education level.\nHe has 1 son and 1 daughter with his ex-wife, namely Yu Tian and Yu Qize.\nA person who had worked with Yu Zhusheng earlier told Netease Qingliu Studio that Yu Zhusheng started early and started to work step by step as a construction team.\nAs early as 2008, most of the real estate projects he started to engage in were cooperative development with various township governments, buying lands in some remote places, relying on low-cost cooperative development and construction, earning differential returns and making a fortune.\nIndustrial and commercial information also supports the above-mentioned person's statement.\nIn 1990s, Yu Zhusheng was mainly engaged in pile foundation and earthwork construction and concrete supply, etc., and successively established Wuhan South China Pile Machinery Co., Ltd. and Wuhan South China Concrete Supply Center.\nAccording to publicly available materials, Yu Zhusheng began to contact real estate development in 2000.\nIn 2017, the average selling price of the real estate \"Huawei Commercial and Residential Building\" developed in that year was RMB 10,000/square meter, and the surrounding real estate was around RMB 30,000/square meter.\nthe turning point of Yu Zhusheng's real estate business appeared around 2006.\nHe developed 2 projects that were widely known to Wuhan people - one is the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, which is the source of pneumonia epidemic, and the other is the South China International Plaza, which is a high-end real estate under the South China Group; Both plots are reconstruction projects of Tangjiadun Village in Jianghan District, Wuhan.\nIn 2006, Yu Zhusheng chose this land.\nAccording to the announcement of a land agreement transfer plan published by Wuhan Natural Resources and Planning Bureau in 2006, 24,000 square meters of land located in Tangjiadun Village, Tangjiadun Street was transferred to Yu Zhusheng's Wuhan Huawei Property Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Huawei Property\") at a price of RMB 100 million after Land Resource Bureau researching.\nSouth China Seafood Wholesale Market emerged from the ground and is positioned as the largest seafood market in Central China, with a construction area of 50,000 square meters and accommodating thousands of shops.\nIt is worth noting that the Tangjiadun \"Village in City\" reconstruction project involves demolition, which once attracted much attention because of \"violent demolition\".\nThe demolition party exposed in the public information includes Wuhan Huawei Property Development Co., Ltd. (responsible person Yu Zhusheng, hereinafter referred to as \"Huawei Property\").\nSome villagers in Tangjiadun once clashed with the demolition party for the low compensation fee for demolition, and even suffered bloody casualties.\nSome villagers initiated an administrative lawsuit against Jianghan District People's Government in 2012 because the local government did not make it public according to the procedures.\n\nIn the first-instance judgment ((2014) EJAXCZ No.00008) published by Jiang 'an District People's Court of Wuhan City in 2014, the court ruled that Jianghan District Government should give a reply within days to the villagers' request to disclose the specific payment and use of land acquisition compensation subsidies for the \"Village in City\" reconstruction project.\nBy intervening in the Tangjiadun Village Reconstruction Project, Yu Zhusheng and his South China Group were able to enter the vision of Wuhan public.\nBut the outside world is still curious, why did the little-known small developer get the Tangjiadun project plot in 2006?\nBy contrast, the developers of other projects in Tangjiadun are all developed by “Wuhan Joint Venture Vanke Real Estate Co., Ltd.”, which is a cooperation between Wuhan State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and Vanke.\nWhat is more noteworthy is that it is at the key turning point of Tangjiadun Project that a mysterious businessman began to surface.\nIn the public information of that year, one of the demolition parties was Huawei Property, and there were also Wuhan Sun Property Development Co., Ltd. and Wuhan Zeshenghe Real Estate Development Co., Ltd..\nThe chairman of both companies is Chen Zhixiang.\nIn the social relations of Yu family, this person is a key figure.\nKey person and Wuhan state-owned assets\nFrom the industrial and commercial information, Chen Zhixiang cooperated closely with the Yu family.\nNetease Qingliu Studio combed down the corporate map behind Yu's family, and found that Chen Zhixiang and his close relative Xiong Qiang appeared in the ownership structure of many companies.\nAs early as 2009, Chen Zhixiang controlled Wuhan Sun Property Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Sun Property\") and Yu Zhusheng's South China Seafood Market Co., Ltd. established a pawn company-Wuhan Fusheng Pawn Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Fusheng Pawn\"), which involved many large-scale usurious loan in disguise.\nAccording to several judgments inquired by Netease Qingliu Studio, Fusheng Pawnshop has granted millions or even tens of millions of loans to many natural persons, which were actually private loans, and the lending rates all exceed the upper limit of “the Supreme People's Court's Provisions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Trial of Private Lending Cases” (hereinafter referred to as the \"Supreme Court Lending Regulations\"), and they are judged as usury by the court, and those exceeding the interest rates are not supported.\nXiong Qiang, a close business person of Chen Zhixiang, served as assistant to the general manager of Wuhan Vanke Real Estate Co., Ltd. from 2001 to 2014, and then left Vanke to work as an executive in a company controlled by Chen Zhixiang.\nIn 2014, he joined as the chairman of Wuhan Kaisheng Economic and Trade Development Co., Ltd. controlled by Chen Zhixiang, and since August 2016, he has served as the chairman of Dalian Friendship (000679.SH) controlled by Chen Zhixiang.\nChen Zhixiang, Yu Tian (daughter of Yu Zhusheng) and Xiong Qiang also took shares in Wuhan Shengshi Tianlai Culture Communication Partnership (Limited Partnership), holding 32.5%, 25% and 2.5% respectively.\nIn association with Chen Zhixiang, Xiong Qiang and others, the Yu family began to aim real estate projects from Wuhan to the outside of the province in the later period.\nIn March 2017, Yu Tian and Xiong Qiang invested 1:1 to establish Wuhan Zhujiu Economic and Trade Development Co., Ltd., and the latter obtained 50% equity of Shaanxi Wancheng Investment Development Co., Ltd. through agreement transfer.\nIn the same year, Yu Tian and Xiong Qiang invested 1:1 to establish Wuhan Hezhu Economic and Trade Development Co., Ltd., and the latter established Xi 'an Zehe Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. together with Xi 'an Vanke Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., in which Xi 'an Vanke was the controlling shareholder with 70% shares and Wuhan Zhujiu held 30% shares.\nHowever, the outside world still didn't know who this \"Chen Zhixiang\" is.\nAccording to casual information, Chen Zhixiang is from Jianghan District, Wuhan, and is the executive director of Wuhan Sun Property Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Sun Property\"), and Sun Property is held by Chen Zhixiang and his mother Yang Cuixiang.\nChen Zhixiang’s development properties were only in Wuhan area.\nThis is the information disclosed by the company when Chen Zhixiang entered Dalian Friendship (000679.SH) in 2016.\nAccording to the disclosure announcement in July of that year, Wuxin Investment Holdings (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Wuxin Shenzhen\") received 28% of the original controlling shareholder of Dalian Friendship with 1.3 billion cash and became the controlling shareholder of Dalian Friendship.\nThe actual controller of Dalian Friendship was changed to Chen Zhixiang.\nWhat is worth paying attention to is that Chen Zhixiang entered Dalian Friendship, in fact, he joined hands with Wuhan SASAC.\nAccording to the announcement, Wuxin Shenzhen, the transferee of Dalian Friendship Control, has its corporate shareholders including Wuhan Kaisheng Economic and Trade Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Kaisheng Economic and Trade\"), Wuhan Hengsheng Jiaye Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Hengsheng Jiaye\") and Wuhan Credit Investment Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Wuxin Investment Group\"), with the shareholding ratio of the three parties being 38%, 22% and 40%.\nDalian Friendship disclosed that Kaisheng Economic & Trade and Hengsheng Jiaye are both enterprises controlled by natural person Chen Zhixiang, and Wuxin Investment Group is a credit guarantee enterprise under Wuhan SASAC.\nThis means that Chen Zhixiang and Wuhan SASAC have a substantial shareholding ratio of 60% and 40% in Wuxin Shenzhen.\nDalian Friendship said that there is no relationship between Chen Zhixiang and Wuxin Investment Group, and there is no concerted action arrangement.\nHowever, one detail is that among the members of Dalian Friendship Board of Directors after Chen Zhixiang took office, 2 new directors, besides Xiong Qiang representing Chen Zhixiang, the other is Li Jian, who is a member of Wuhan State-owned Assets System, and 2 new members of the Board of Supervisors, including Chairman Gao Zhichao and Supervisor Fan Sining, are all members of Wuhan SASAC System.\nThat is to say, in the listed companies actually controlled by Chen Zhixiang, Wuhan State-owned Assets System is actually stronger than Chen Zhixiang in the seats of directors and supervisors.\nOn January 8, 2020, the company announced that its controlling shareholder Wuxin Shenzhen had signed a share transfer agreement with Wuhan Development and Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Wuhan Kaitou\") after Dalian Friendship was deeply mired in litigation disputes over overdue debts and equity transfer of its subsidiaries.\nAfter the transfer is completed, the actual controller of Dalian Friendship will be changed from Chen Zhixiang, which is controlled by Wuxin Investment, to Wuhan SASAC, the actual controller of Wuhan Kaitou.\nThe public records show that the \"cooperation\" between Chen Zhixiang and Wuhan SASAC is not limited to Dalian Friendship.\nWuxin Investment also appeared in the equity battle of another listed company, New Huangpu (600638.SH).\nIn June, 2017, Wuxin Investment acquired 32.75% of the rights and interests of the new Huangpu by purchasing trust.\nWhen China Times reported the above-mentioned equity competition of New Huangpu, it quoted people familiar with the matter as saying that the sources of funds of Wuxin Shenzhen and Wuxin Investment Group were probably related to Wuhan Financial Holding. When the reporter asked whether Wuxin Shenzhen belonged to Wuhan Financial Holding Group (referred to as Wuhan Finacial Holding for short), the insider blurted out that it was, but when asked in detail, he faltered.\nIn addition, Wuhan Changsheng Industrial Co., Ltd. was established in cooperation between Chen Zhixiang and the holding enterprises of Wuhan SASAC, in which Sun Property of Chen Zhixiang holds 49% of the shares, and the shareholders of the other two companies are holding enterprises of Wuhan SASAC.\nAccording to the data collected, the company is mainly engaged in real estate development business, and has successively developed projects such as Sunshine Mansion, Tianli Garden, Dingxiu Crystal City, Ink Qinghua and Dingxiu Palaza.\nThe Yu's family can also find a connection with the state-owned assets system.\nYu Zhusheng, who is engaged in real estate-related business, registered as an advertising company \"Wuhan Shenghua Advertising Co., Ltd.\" in January 2003.\nAnother natural person shareholder of the company is Wang Houfang.\nAccording to the related information of Qixinbao, Wang Houfang was the legal representative and chairman of Hubei Hongtai Cultural Travel Industry Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Hongtai Cultural Travel\") and Hubei Hongtai Baibuting Investment Management Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Hongtai Baibuting Investment\"). \nAmong them, Hongtai Cultural Travel is a wholly-owned company of Hubei SASAC after penetration, and Hongtai Baibuting Investment is a holding company of Hubei SASAC after penetration.\nLiu Pei is a senior author of Qingliu Studio, based in Beijing.\nProduced by Netease Qingliu Studio (WeChat: wangyiqingliu), it is forbidden to reprint without authorization.\nQingliu Studio is the original financial investigation team of Netease Finance.

One is that there is really no material; One is to plan ahead; There is another type, which is that materials were sent to Wuhan.\nA hospital staff who participated in fund-raising explained that the reason for choosing fund-raising instead of purchasing was that the hospital procurement process is complicated, and it is difficult to complete the process in a short time, while fund-raising is much more direct.\nAmong 11 kinds of emergency materials and equipment in the “Catalog of Health Emergency Materials Reserve in Guizhou Province”, there were only 5 kinds and 2 kinds that have reached 100% in the city and county level disease control institutions respectively; there were only 22.2% of city and state-level disease control institutions have complete management records (including lists, warehousing registration, etc.), and only 18.5% of county-level disease control institutions.\nIn December 2019, a piece of essay written by the staff of Hubei CDC showed that the physical value of all reserves of hospitals in Hubei Province in 2016 was RMB 670,100.\nAccording to the report of the National Development and Reform Commission, since \"9.11\" and \"anthrax\", the US medical reserve budget has increased from US$ 50 million to US$ 600 million (about RMB 4.2 billion).\nThis article was first published in the Southern Weekend and cannot be reproduced without authorization\nWrittent by | Southern Weekly Reporters: Wang Weikai, Zhou Xiaoling and Jin Yibu\nSouther Weekend Intern: Gong Roushan\nManaging Editor |  Zhang Yue\nBy the morning of January 28, 2020, 74 medical organizations outside Hubei Province had appealed for help, including many well-known hospitals.\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, the shortage of medical materials has become the biggest problem in hospitals.\nInitially, hospitals in Wuhan began to face the public, announce the contact information of their employees and seek social donations.\nThen, the number of hospitals in Hubei Province increased to nearly 90.\nThen, this “Helping” wave of hospitals spread all over the country.\nAccording to the statistics of Southern Weekend reporters, by the morning of January 28, there were as many as 71 hospitals that issued help information outside Hubei Province, in order of quantity: Sichuan Province (17), Guangdong Province (11), Anhui Province (10), Zhejiang Province (9), Hainan Province (4), Beijing (3), Gansu Province (3), Shaanxi Province (3), the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (2), Shandong Province (2), Henan Province (1), Hunan Province (2), Shanxi Province (1), Shanghai (1), Jiangxi Province (1) and Jiangsu Province (1).\nIt covered county-level, municipal-level, provincial-level hospitals and even national famous hospitals.\nIn addition, there were 3 non-hospital institutions asking for help: Cangnan County Health Bureau in Zhejiang Province, Xianju County Prevention and Control Headquarters, and Longgang City Leading Group for Joint Prevention and Control of Pneumonia Epidemic.\nAfter SARS in 2003, China experienced many large-scale infectious diseases, such as Streptococcus Suis infection in Sichuan in 2005, Influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, H7N9 avian influenza infection in 2013, and import of Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015.\nAfter several epidemic situations, why is there still such a general shortage of medical supplies?\n1. The procurement process is complicated, donation is more direct.\nOn January 26, Gan County People's Hospital of Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province released a message of accepting donations, and urgently needed N95 masks, protective clothing and impact goggles.\nThis county-level people's hospital is the only designated hospital for treating pneumonia patients with COVID-19. At present, there has been a shortage of protective equipment.\nThe hospital staff told Southern Weekend reporters that they had almost no masks and goggles. On January 25, in order to test patients, they borrowed a set of masks from Xianyang Central Hospital.\n“We want to buy, but we cannot.\nDonating money is useless, what we need is material.”\nHe told Southern Weekend reporter that there have been one confirmed case in Gan County, and if more suspected patients came to check, the crisis of material shortage would become more prominent.\nOn the same day, the Central Hospital of Zhumadian, Henan Province also issued an announcement of emergency procurement and donation acceptance. The contact person of the hospital also told Southern Weekend reporters that they are not short of money, but lack of materials.\nNot only county and municipal hospitals were short of materials, but also provincial hospitals and even well-known hospitals in China.\nOn January 25, Hainan Provincial People's Hospital issued an announcement asking all sectors of society to donate protective materials.\nThe staff of the hospital office told Southern Weekend reporter that there were no fewer than 120 medical personnel in the hospital at present, and the quarantine consumables needed to be replaced regularly.\nOnly for protective clothings, they needed 200 sets every day to meet the demand.\nDue to the shortage of disposable protective consumables, front-line medical personnel can only reduce the frequency of going to the toilet or choose to wear adult diapers.\nThe China-Japan Friendship Hospital directly under the National Health Commission of People’s Republic of China also issued a fund-raising announcement on the same day.\nBut after one day, the announcement has been deleted on the website of the hospital.\n\"Don't allow us to make announcements, we still welcome to raise materials privately.\"\nA Beijing hospital staff who also issued an announcement revealed to the Southern Weekend reporter that \"the announcement was withdrawn to prevent panic. It seems that the hospital has treated many patients, but it is not. It is just a preparation. I am afraid that new patients will come with insufficient materials and cannot be admitted.\"\nA hospital staff who participated in fund-raising explained that the reason for choosing fund-raising instead of purchasing was that the hospital procurement process is complicated, and it is difficult to complete the process in a short time, while fund-raising is much more direct.\n2. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology leads material security\nSouthern Weekend reporters interviewed more than 20 hospital contacts who issued announcements.\nTo sum up, there are 3 types of reasons for hospitals to ask for donations. One is that there is really no material; One is to plan ahead; There is another type, which is that materials were sent to Wuhan.\nThe staff of Gan County People's Hospital in Shaanxi Province said that their county-level hospitals usually had few protective clothing, especially anti-impact masks.\nThis kind of materials was not needed at ordinary times. When encountering a minor epidemic, they could be bought temporarily or borrowed from brother hospitals. However, when encountering such a national epidemic, epidemic prevention materials were not enough, and they couldn't be bought if they wanted to.\nOn January 25, the famous West China Hospital, Sichuan University also joined the fund-raising.\nA staff of the hospital told the Southern Weekend reporter that the hospital's team that rushed to Wuhan took away most of the inventory. At present, triage, fever clinic, infection and quarantine wards all needed to consume a large amount of related supplies. The hospital vacated more than 400 beds to treat quarantined patients, so it needed to raise money.\nDoctors in intensive care unit of an AAA hospital in Haikou City, Hainan Province also told Southern Weekend reporter that the existing reserve materials in the hospital were sufficient, but the medical personnel who rushed to Wuhan needed to take away some protective materials, so they donated money to the society in advance.\nThe staff of Hainan Provincial People's Hospital Office confirmed to Southern Weekend reporter that after SARS, the hospital quickly determined the emergency plan and prepared for the emergency in the hospital's internal treatment process. However, because the supply side resources need to give priority to the epidemic areas where the supply is scarce, \"some goods we ordered have been transferred there\".\nAt present, the goods of Hainan's reworked factories also give priority to supporting areas with serious epidemic situation.\nDuring this epidemic situation, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology led material security\nA departmental cadre of the Provincial Department of Industry and Information Technology told Southern Weekend reporter that this is because \"the production of health materials is coordinated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology\".\nTake Guangdong Province as an example. On January 27, the official WeChat of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released a message that the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry and Information Technology is the head unit of the material security group of the Guangdong Provincial Epidemic Prevention and Control Command, and is responsible for convening all members of the provincial government, the Guangdong Branch of Customs and the Red Cross Society to work together to solve the problems of enterprise resumption of production and material supply.\nAt the press conference of the State Council on January 26, Wang Jiangping, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, revealed that in the demand list sent by Wuhan to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 100,000 sets of medical protective clothing are needed every day, and 3 million sets are needed per month.\nHowever, during the Spring Festival, the rework rate of domestic protective clothing was only 40%.\nHowever, there were only 40 qualified enterprises that meet the standards in China, which were also distributed in 14 provinces with a daily production capacity of 30,000 sets.\nThat is to say, all domestic compliant protective clothing enterprises were supplied to Wuhan together, and only one third of the demand could be produced in one day.\nWang Jiangping said that there are still some enterprises with export production capacity, which can produce 50,000 sets of protective clothing every day, but without the permission of Chinese standards, it will take a little time to change.\nMiao Wei, Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said during an investigation in Tianjin on January 23 that China is the world's largest producer of masks, with a maximum production capacity of more than 20 million masks per day.\nAt present, more than 30 enterprises have resumed production, with the output reaching more than 8 million a day.\nHowever, masks are medical consumables that can be changed for many times one day, and this production capacity was difficult to meet the demand.\nOn the evening of January 27, the boss of a mask manufacturer told Southern Weekend reporter that the street department in the jurisdiction had already registered.\nIn the face of material shortage, Wang Jiangping, deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, also proposed 4 plans: using central reserve; do everything possible to resume work and resume production, and rapidly increase production capacity from 40%; solve the problem of convergence between export and Chinese standards. exported products that meet European and American standards can be used in China; strengthen international cooperation and promote international procurement to meet domestic needs.\nSo how much are the central reserves?\nOn January 27th, when the Southern Weekend reporter called the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology for news interview, no one answered, and the interviewed scholars and experts all said they didn't know about the emergency materials reserve.\n3. The material reserve has a system and has not landed\nIn fact, since SARS in 2003, the system design of medical material reserve in China has already been completed.\nIn 2004, the revised “Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases” stipulated that the people's governments at or above the county level should reserve medicines, medical devices and other materials for the prevention and control of infectious diseases for use.\nIn the following two years, the State Council has successively formulated the “National General Emergency Plan for Public Emergencies”, “the National Emergency Plan for Public Health Emergencies”, “the National Emergency Plan for Medical and Health Rescue for Public Emergencies” and “the Guidelines for Preparing Emergency Plans for Community (Township) Emergencies for Public Health Emergencies (for Trial Implementation)”.\nThe above plans all pointed out that people's governments at all levels need to establish reserves of materials and production capacity for dealing with public health emergencies.\nIn 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission issued the \"Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) for Emergency Acute Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Plan\", and proposed to improve the material reserve system.\nSouthern Weekend reporter learned on the website of the National Health Commission that the emergency reserve work is the responsibility of CDC at all levels in China, which mainly stores emergency equipment, biological products, diagnostic reagents, disinfection drugs and protective equipment.\nSo why didn't these protective appliances, which had been reserved in theory, solve the problem at the critical moment?\nSouthern Weekend reporters inquired a large number of academic essays of several provincial CDC staff, and found that the emergency material reserves and daily management in several provinces in China were not optimistic.\nIn February 2019, the staff of Guizhou Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention published an article introducing the health emergency response capacity of Guizhou Province in 2017.\nAmong the 11 kinds of emergency materials and equipment listed in the Catalogue of Health Emergency Materials in Guizhou Province, there are only 5 kinds and 2 kinds of emergency materials and equipment with the reserve rate reaching 100% in the city and county level CDC respectively, among which the logistics support reserve, vaccine and drug reserve are obviously insufficient.\nIncomplete material reserve management system is also a long-term situation.\nOnly 55.6% of the state-level disease control institutions in Guizhou have established the material management system and work flow, while 60.9% of them have established the material management system at the county level.\nOnly 22.2% of city and state-level disease control institutions have complete management records (including lists, warehousing registration, etc.), and only 18.5% of county-level disease control institutions.\nIn an essay published in 2016, the staff of Hainan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention mentioned that the health departments at all levels in Hainan have formulated the catalog of health emergency materials reserve at the same level, but they have not established the mechanism for transferring health emergency materials reserve, and there is no material reserve system and management platform.\nAn article published by the staff of Shanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015 showed that most of the existing emergency materials in the province were purchased under emergency conditions when emergencies occurred. The reserve quantity was unreasonable and the quality was single. Personal protective equipment was mainly used, and there were a large number of expired materials.\nShenzhen is a first-tier city in China. In August, 2016, the staff of CDC also published an introduction article. One conclusion was that the personal protective equipment reserve is a weak link in Shenzhen's health emergency work, which is not clearly defined from the wearing order, model type and daily maintenance, and some institutions have insufficient necessary reserve materials.\n4. Inventory of total national material reserves\nAccording to the requirements of emergency plan and other relevant regulations, the funds needed for health protection and other related materials, equipment and facilities are included in the financial budget of the government at the corresponding level.\nSouthern Weekend reporters combed the national financial accounts of the Ministry of Finance over the years, and found that from 2010 to 2018, the cost of emergency treatment of public health emergencies nationwide was between RMB 600 million and RMB 800 million per year.\nThe expenditure of emergency treatment institutions is RMB 2-3 billion.\nThe annual expenditure on disease prevention and control institutions was more than RMB 30 billion, but it was impossible to find out how much of it is used for medical reserves.\nIn December 2019, an essay published in the core “Journal Public Health and Preventive Medicine” on the eve of the outbreak showed that the physical value of all hospital reserves in Hubei Province was RMB 358,400, RMB 410,900 and RMB 670,100 in each year from 2014 to 2016.\nIn November 2004, more than one year after SARS, the Economic Operation Bureau of the National Development and Reform Commission made a special investigation to the emergency management department of the US Department of Homeland Security and the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The summary of this investigation report is still on the official website of the National Development and Reform Commission.\nAt that time, a conclusion was that the emergency response in the United States was backed by materials and medical supplies.\nAccording to the report, the medical reserve funds are allocated by the government.\nIn order to ensure the effectiveness of the reserve supplies, they should be written off regularly and updated in time.。\nSince \"9.11\" and \"anthrax\", the medical reserve budget has increased from USD 50 million to USD 600 million (about RMB 4.2 billion).\nIn 2017, the staff of the health and welfare department in Taiwan Province, China, made a paper entitled \"Research and Analysis of International Medical Related Material Reserve System\".\nAccording to the essay, at that time, the reserve materials owned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States were worth USD 7 billion (about RMB 49 billion), and the national material distribution time was 12-48 hours.\nThe reserve products include more than 900 kinds of items such as antibiotics, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, vaccines, diagnostic reagents, personal protective equipment, etc., which were stored in 6 confidential storage locations.\nIn the same period, Canada's reserves reached USD 300 million (about RMB 2.1 billion), and Australia's reserves reached USD 200 million (about RMB 1.4 billion ).\nIn addition, this essay also wrote that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stores items with high particularity, difficulty in market circulation, or large demand in third-party logistics companies for inventory management; For easy-to-circulate goods, they shall be stored in the warehouse of the supplier for management, and the manufacturer shall circulate the products coming to the scheduled period to the market, and timely supplement new products.\nIn 2016, a data was quoted in the academic paper of a staff of Beijing Chaoyang District Health Planning Commission. In 2013, the scale of China's medical reserve funds reached RMB 1.2 billion, including RMB 550 million from the central government and RMB 650 million from provinces and cities.\nDistrict-county level reserves are relatively lagging behind. At that time, no statistical data about the average level of districts and counties were found.\nThe article also mentioned that the physical reserve in Chaoyang District of Beijing at that time was RMB 680,000.\nThe article wrote that the established local reserves are basically the physical reserves of personal protective equipment and disinfection medical equipment purchased urgently during SARS or H1N1 prevention and control. Some of the material reserves cannot meet the needs of current health emergency work, but also cause the waste of some emergency materials.\nAccording to the article, health emergency and epidemic prevention materials were mostly stored by disease control institutions, but there was a lack of financial guarantee and personal protective equipment, and there was no systematic catalog for reference by executive departments.\nIn addition, except for limited capital reserves and production capacity reserves in some areas, they were mainly material reserves, lacking effective capital and production capacity reserves.\nOn the morning of January 28, Southern Weekend reporters contacted a number of hospitals seeking donations one after another.\nAt present, the mode of supply is rather confusing.\nA person from a Guangzhou hospital told the Southern Weekend reporter, \"I have been taking the note of the Health Commission to the brother hospitals without patients, and they have stocks to provide us.\"\nA hospital in Sichuan Province said that it began to report to the Health Commission on January 24, and now it reports the consumption of consumables for 48 hours every day, but the materials reported yesterday have not yet been received.\nThe medical team who went to Wuhan took away N95 masks. At present, the hospital was in contact with the provincial government, asking for 400 masks, and 200 masks are allocated at present.\nThe Economic and Information Committee of the provincial government controls the emergency materials warehouse of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, but the approval process is complicated, which requires the approval of the Economic and Information Committee at different levels. \"The business is managed by the Economic and Information Committee, and it is not clear how to manage it\".\nA hospital in Hunan Province said that the monthly consumption is now 50,000 masks and 10,000 sets of protective clothing.These materials will be prepared by hospitals and CDC, but the quantity is not large.\nAt present, there have been new cases in the local area, and the hospital has received some materials from CDC, but the supply chain is in danger of breaking these days.\nOn the morning of January 28, they received good news that a batch of materials had been transferred from the Emergency Management Office of the Municipal Health Commission. \"They were also transferred from other places, which should be transferred from top. They took them from the province and then transferred them to us\".\n\n", "English title": "More than 160 hospitals across the country have asked for social assistance.

Just like we locked down Wuhan, China will be quarantined by other countries.\nMany people may say that Westerners just like to maltreat China. This time, they finally got a chance to watch the good show in China, and then they thought China had fallen into the abyss of depression.\nIt is undeniable that there have always been people who hate China, just like many of us, some people insist that the epidemic was poisoned by the United States.\nWe are all normal individuals, and it is inevitable that all kinds of negative emotions will engulf us and incite narrow nationality hatred for no reason.\nHowever, I also hope that everyone can understand more foreigners' opinions on the current epidemic situation in China and the measures taken by the Chinese government.\nIf there is only one voice in the world, it will be very dangerous.\nAs outsiders, we stand from God's perspective and look at everything in front of our eyes carefully.\nIn an extraordinary period, information is like mud, so we need to calmly and independently think about it .\nIn the past 17 years, with two major epidemics, we still haven’t perfected epidemic prevention system and institutionalized epidemic prevention means. The people and institutions still have no rules to follow, the truth is also covered, and we still panic when something happens.\nChina has been the second largest economy in the world, comparing with many aspects that are leading in the world, and we still need to catch up with the epidemic prevention work concerning the safety of all mankind.\nWe can make progress, only by realizing this point.\n1. Cheongwadae, 500,000 Koreans, petitioned for a ban on Chinese entry\nMr. Xiang Zhi, a Chinese Language Teacher in University, from South Korea   :\nBecause of teaching Chinese, I went to China every year for academic exchange. I have many Chinese friends and love China very much.\nBut this time, I feel complicated and very sad.\nI pay special attention to this epidemic. Firstly, the relevant news was repeatedly broadcast, asking everyone to wear masks and wash their hands frequently. In more than 20 infectious countries, South Korea has ranked fourth, so we had to pay attention.\nIn addition, one case has just been confirmed in our district.\nThis is terrible. My father was just sent to a nursing home last month. He has been over 80 years old and has poor resistance. I am so worried about him.\nI want to take my father home, but I'm not sure if it's safer to go home.\nI am so struggling.\nLike other Koreans, besides Korean media, I have known the epidemic situation in China from social networking sites, which is complicated and difficult to distinguish between true and false, which increases the panic about the epidemic.\nThere are 2 videos on the Internet that are “liked” a lot. One is the Chinese old man who walked and suddenly fell to the ground and died; One is that young Chinese women are eating bats live.\nThere must be some missing real information in these videos without antecedents and consequences, but normal people don't think so. Everyone believes that seeing is believing. When people suddenly fall to the ground, their intuition is that this infectious disease is terrible, and the Chinese with this disease are so terrible!\n(It was later confirmed to be a rumor)。\nSouth Korea's \"Joong Ang Ilbo\" reported on the 28th day that 556,000 Koreans filed a petition to Cheongwadae (the presidential palace of South Korea), demanding that \"the Chinese be banned from entering the country immediately\".\nJust 2 days ago, the Korean Medical Doctor Association published a public talk on \"Asking to consider banning Chinese from entering the country\", which had a great influence on Korean people.\nNow, don't mention Chinese, even for Koreans who have lived in China, and Korean people don't want them to go back.\nMore than 600 expatriates living in Wuhan were picked up by the Korean government on 30th and 31st.\nThere are 2 conditions attached to receiving expatriates:\n1. \"Those who don’t have Korean nationality are not allowed to board the plane\";\n2. \"Those with fever above 37.5℃, vomiting, cough, sore throat and dyspnea are not allowed to board the plane\".\nThat means that the Korean daughter-in-law or son-in-law in Wuhan may be forced to separate, and those who are ill can only stay in the epidemic area and seek more happiness for themselves.\nNot only that, the expatriates who take back South Korea can't return to their own homes, and they need to be observed in quarantine.\nAt the beginning, the residents of the selected quarantined resettlement area also went to Cheongwadae to petition, and they blocked the road, and these expatriates were not allowed to settle here.\nCan you understand what I said?\nIt means that even ordinary Korean people are afraid of their compatriots, not to mention Chinese people!\n除了这些，我还特别不能理解，疫情发生后，当地政府不是及时通报，而是忙着开运动会，层层请示上级等指示，这在韩国肯定是不可能发生的。\nIn addition to these, I can't understand that after the outbreak, the local government was busy holding sports meetings and asking for instructions from superiors, which is definitely impossible in Korea.\nAlso, the government has ordered the \"city lockdown\". Why are there a large number of Wuhan people traveling around the world?\nChinese students in my university often say that Koreans discriminate against Chinese students. What I understand is that Chinese people generally don't abide by the laws and regulations. I don't know if China is too big and South Korea is too small. If you don't abide by the rules, it will get confused. This is our bottom line.\nAlthough these Chinese students are not my students, I often communicate with them and tell them the rules and habits of Koreans. I think as long as we can abide by Korean rules seriously, there will be no discrimination.\nAt present, 4 cases have been found in Korea, all of which came back from Wuhan. If you think about it, one of them has contacted more than 300 people, and these more than 300 people have to be quarantined.\nNot everyone is afraid of death. Once a small country like ours is infected, there is no way to control it, whether it is manpower or material resources.\nThere is also news on the Internet that this illness is not from wild animals, but from an experiment of an infectious disease research institute in Wuhan, which is a man-made disaster.\nIn addition, after the outbreak, the local government did not report it in time and concealed the news, which also aggravated the Korean people's suspicion of the Chinese government.\nI don't know the truth of this news. After all, it hasn't determined where the virus came from until now, and many of the first infected cases haven't touched the seafood market.\nIn a word, I hope the Chinese government can find the source and control the epidemic as soon as possible.\nNo matter where the virus comes from, it is an indisputable fact that most infectious diseases come from wild animals.\nI hope that Chinese people will stop eating wild animals. Every life is precious. We can't bring trouble to so many innocent people because of ourselves.\nInfectious diseases are not from any country, but from all over the world. If we resist the Chinese people, the virus will not disappear.\nWe must unite, and every country should think like this.\n\n2. Chinese people only believe in politics, not science\n日本 翔子 新闻记者\nSyoko,  Journalist from Japan   \nI am a journalist in Japan. On January 1, 2020, I heard about the new pneumonia in Wuhan on WeChat and Weibo.\nWhen I first heard that Wuhan Public Security Bureau had detained 8 \"rumor mongers\", I was surprised and felt how this could happen.\nAnyway, this is impossible in Japan. First of all, we journalists will not agree.\nAt present, there have been 7 confirmed cases with new pneumonia in Japan, which have been treated in quarantine.\nAll 6 infected people came from Wuhan or lived in Wuhan.\nA 60-year-old Japanese bus driver was added. This is the first time that Japanese people have been infected with COVID-19. Although he did not stay in Wuhan, he took Wuhan tourists by bus twice.\nChina and Japan are adjacent to each other, so everyone focused on it and wears masks.\nHowever, due to the massive purchase of masks by Chinese people in the coming days, the market demand is increasing, and even out of stock in some areas.\nSince the outbreak began, lots of Japanese drugstores have put up the slogan \"Come on Wuhan\", and the government and enterprises have donated masks and protective clothing to help Wuhan.\nIt also provides good services for tourists stranded in Japan, such as setting a precedent and extending short-term tourist visas for 30 days.\nIn an interview with Phoenix Satellite TV yesterday, the secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, the core figure of the Anpei regime, said that China's current situation is like a relative getting ill for Japan, and we will do our best to help.\nHe said that there has always been friendship between China and Japan. This sudden epidemic is like a sudden fire in a neighbor's house or illness, and a relative is sick. The Japanese want to help the whole country. The Japanese all think so and hope that the masks and protective clothing donated by Japan can play a role in this epidemic.\nFor this move by Japanese society and government, most people expressed their support:\n\"It's really good to help each other in difficult times. Now food should be in short supply, so if there is extra space (plane), even if it is instant noodles, I hope to send some.\"\n\"It is best to load some relief supplies and milk powder in the event of a disaster.\"\n\"I heard from Chinese friends that logistics has stopped, and there is no food in the supermarket. I am a little worried about what children should do, and I hope that materials and food can support more.\"\nIn this Spring Festival, I wanted to wish Chinese friends a happy Chinese New Year!\nBut I can't be happy in my heart. Looking at the people in Wuhan who are trapped in a quarantine, I don't know how they live during the Chinese New Year.\nAlso, during the Chinese New Year, the medical workers who went to the epidemic areas are the greatest people.\nThis incident also proves once again that Chinese people only trust the government, leaders and official media, but not science.\nMany people think that politics and leaders can do anything, and as long as they have power, they can cope with any disaster.\nI don't think that's actually the case.\nThere is not an invulnerable system, and even the most powerful system has its weaknesses.\nDuring SARS, some weaknesses of Chinese system still existed.\nFor example, local governments are waiting for their superiors, while local leaders are waiting for the leadership of the central government. It seems that before the central government expresses, local governments cannot do anything or admit the epidemic crisis.\nTherefore, concealing the news, lax and lazy politics, as if everything was normal, nothing happened.\nAfter the epidemic spread and the higher-level government and leaders focus on it, local governments took action.\nHubei provincial government and Wuhan municipal government, as local governments, are accustomed to their own situation of being struggling, habitually accepting the command of the central government, habitually falling into the old-fashioned report, and delaying the best time for prevention and control without receiving the instructions from the central government.\nThese are created under different political systems. In a word, it is difficult for us to understand, but it does exist.\n3. In Spain, wearing a mask will be discriminated against\nBrenell     Athlete from Spain     \nI am French, but I live in Spain, so I don't know how many people are infected in France. There were suspected cases in Spain before, but they were ruled out later.\nI heard about COVID-19 before Christmas, and it was reported on TV and Instagram.\nHowever, I only looked at it and didn't know much about it. I only knew that many people began to discriminate against Chinese people because of this incident.\nPreviously, a woman from Wuhan showed off on the social network, saying that she had symptoms such as fever and cough, but relieved the symptoms with drugs, and successfully passed the fever test at the French airport to enter the country.\nShe also uploaded photos of herself dining in a Michelin-starred restaurant in France.\nIt is said that Chinese netizens reported her.\nThe Chinese Embassy also confirmed that the woman had contacted the French emergency department and had her body temperature measured.\nIt is reported that the woman left Wuhan where COVID-19 outbreak before the flight took off.\nThis kind of selfish behavior makes foreigners misunderstand Chinese seriously, which is very bad.\nTV media reports are quite objective statements of facts, but on social networking sites such as Twitter and IG, there are some public opinion-oriented information, some of which are even discriminatory.\n\nFor example, Twitter had a post reprinted. A Chinese woman in Tik Tok is drinking bat soup. This video was praised a lot. I also saw a video of a Chinese dipping in tomato sauce and eating live mice. It's disgusting.\n(In fact, it is a rumor)\nAt present, in the streets of Spain, there are only a few Asian faces wearing masks, while others don't. After all, they are far away from us and have little influence.\nChinese students around me store masks, but they don't dare to wear them outside, because it will lead to discrimination.\nThey are Asian faces. If they wear masks, others will think that she has been infected with the virus and will avoid them.\nAnother friend traveled to France, coughed twice on the train, and all the people around him moved far away.\nOf course, I also have Chinese friends who insist on wearing masks every day and never care about other people's opinions. They are very brave.\n\nI hope China can develop the vaccine as soon as possible. After all, China has a large population, which is really scary to spread.\n\n4. Without proper propaganda, how can people cooperate with the government's work\n韩国 俊杰 商人\n Jun Jie, Businessman from South Korea       \nI am a Korean, but I have lived in China for 20 years before I returned to South Korea after the financial crisis. China is relatively concerned.\nAt the beginning of January this year, watching Korean TV news, I learned that there was unknown pneumonia in Wuhan.\nLooking at online media on the 20th, I predicted at that time that it might be SARS virus.\nI didn't expect it to be so serious later, and I was always nervous about seeing medical supplies.\nThis made me wonder China is so rich in materials and masks loved by other countries are all made in China, and why China is always lack of masks?\nAre there so many materials that can't reach the front line of the hospital?\nFor this epidemic situation, not to mention the Chinese people, even I was very angry when I watch them, and the people's right to know was seriously deprived!\nWithout proper propaganda, how can people cooperate with the government's work\nLater, after the lockdown of the city, I also watched a video of the police smashing the chess room, which was incredible.\nKoreans' feelings towards China have always been complicated, because of the THAAD incident, Koreans have bad feelings towards China, and there is always negative news about China.\nAnyway, there are many bad comments about China on the Internet, and there is basically no special discrimination against Chinese people in reality.\nFor Koreans in Wuhan, China, the government has sent 2 charter flights to take them home.\nAfter returning to South Korea, they will be quarantined from the outside and tested for 14 days.\nAt the beginning, the people in the quarantine area did not accept these expatriates, but the impact was not great. The government had already negotiated a solution, after all, it was still people of our own country.\nConsidering the urgent need of medical supplies in Wuhan, the Korean government provided 2 million masks, 1 million medical masks, 100,000 protective clothing and 100,000 pairs of protective goggles.\nSome of these materials will be shipped to Wuhan by chartered plane to meet overseas Chinese.\nSpeaking of Wuhan, what impressed me most was that I was very moved and shocked to watch Wuhan people standing on the balcony singing the national anthem.\nAlthough Chinese people are usually weak in playing football, the spirit of fighting virus is extremely strong. We can feel it from their singing voice, which has to be admired.\nThis incident has a great impact on all countries. On January 28, the first day after the Spring Festival holiday in South Korea, the stock price of Seoul financial market opened sharply reduced by more than 3%, and the exchange rate of KRW to USD rose sharply.\nCome on!\nChinese people are so tenacious, nothing can't be overcome!\n\n5. China's remedial measures to deal with the epidemic are beyond most countries\n泰国 Nara saka 日本旅行社社长\nNara Saka    Manager of Japanese Travel Agency, from Thailand    \nI've been doing the ground pick-up service in Japan and Thailand. In recent years, Chinese outbound travel has been very popular, especially in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, so I pay more attention to China.\nProbably one day before the Chinese New Year's Eve, I accidentally saw the news of viruses appearing in Wuhan, because I didn't feel much serious because of my ignorance of medical knowledge.\nHowever, on New Year's Eve, I received a message for help from a friend in Wuhan who worked in the United States and hoped that I could mobilize the Thai business community to donate masks to support Wuhan.\nAt that time, I felt that the situation was serious. I quickly contacted various organizations in Thailand, hoping to help.\nBut to my surprise, the masks that my friends want most have been snapped up by Chinese people in Thailand, including the countryside like Chiang Rai, and the store also says: The masks are out of stock.\nI went to several hospitals in Thailand, but none of them had masks, or there were a few, which was not enough for donation.\nI seldom face this kind of powerless situation, and I felt very sorry for not helping my friends.\nI looked at the statistics, because of the sudden outbreak, more than 20,000 Wuhan people were stranded in Thailand during the Spring Festival.\nAt present, all the cases found are Chinese tourists, and only one is a Thai citizen who has been to Wuhan.\nI don't know if it's the climate. Anyway, these cases in Thailand are either cured or get better without death.\nI also saw all kinds of comments about China on the Internet. Generally, it started to be much more negative, and slowly returned to rationality.\nFor example, they don't like hygiene, like eating wild animals, the local government's inaction, concealing the truth of the epidemic situation, and so on.\nChina's huge system, we can't deny its defects, there is no perfect social system in the world.\nTherefore, we can't just stare at the defects, but look at a series of remedial measures and efforts made by the government irrationally.\n\nFor example, ordering the lockdown of the city to cut off the source of infection, it is the most important festival for Chinese people during the Spring Festival, and it is also the time when activities are most frequent. To make this decision and put it in place, it needs strong administrative ability, which most countries can't do.\nFor example, a hospital dedicated to treating this disease should be built within a week. I watched the live video on the Internet, and the scene was too shocking. It was not only a lot of manpower, material resources and financial resources, but also needed strict organization and management to make the construction period go smoothly.\nIn addition, China quickly dispatched military doctors to Wuhan immediately, and countless doctors and nurses from all over the country took the initiative to write applications and went to Wuhan for treatment. They were really brave.\nI have traveled all over the world, and I have lived in Japan for more time than in Thailand. I can feel the progress and development of China in all aspects. As long as the highest level gives an order, the response speed to the epidemic is faster than that of any other country.\nThis is something that our country cannot do.\n\n", "English title": "China under the epidemic in the eyes of foreigners: singing the national anthem, drinking bat soup and only believe in the government", "原文標題": "外国人眼里的疫情中国：唱国歌，喝蝙蝠汤和只相信政府的中国人"}, {"slug": "6363", "English content": "Foreign nurses were beaten man diagnosed filing, Guangzhou existing nine cases of imported cases in ", "English title": "Foreign diagnosed man is charged with beating the nurse, nine imported cases from Nigeria in Guangzhou", "原文標題": "外籍确诊男子殴打护士被立案，广州现有九例尼日利亚输入病例"}, {"slug": "6364", "English content": "", "English title": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs: with immediate effect, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters stationed in Beijing will be revoked", "原文標題": "外交部：即日起，吊销《华尔街日报》三名驻京记者的记者证"}, {"slug": "6365", "English content": "", "English title": "Foreign Ministry: China has decided to send anti-epidemic medical expert teams to Zimbabwe and three other African countries", "原文標題": "外交部：中方决定向津巴布韦等非洲三国派遣抗疫医疗专家组"}, {"slug": "6366", "English content": "", "English title": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs: China has decided to increase its cash donation of US $30 million to WHO", "原文標題": "外交部：中方决定向世卫组织增加3000万美元现汇捐款"}, {"slug": "6367", "English content": "", "English title": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs: China sticks to the forefront of epidemic prevention and control", "原文標題": "外交部：中国坚守在疫情防控的最前线"}, {"slug": "6368", "English content": "(News article from surging more information please download the original \"surging News\" APP) March 5", "English title": "The foreign ministry refutes the remarks made by the US host asking China to apologize for the epidemic: ridiculous and groundless", "原文標題": "外交部驳美主持人要中国就疫情道歉言论：荒谬可笑，毫无根据"}, {"slug": "6369", "English content": "", "English title": "Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying: China has strengthened cooperation with the WHO and the international community in an open, transparent and responsible manner.

of the car and came back with pale looking: someone put up a tombstone in the middle of the road.\n\"They are afraid that we escaped from Wuhan.\" father's voice was a little excited. \"They don't want us to pass here.\"\nFrom fear to worry to discrimination everywhere, Hubei people have experienced a psychological drift in the past week.\nAs “People's Daily” said: \"Anti-epidemic\" cannot be \"fear of Hubei\", and our only common enemy is COVID-19.\nThe good news is that this situation is slowly changing.\n1. Hubei A, 4201 and Wuhan accent\nOn January 24, early in the morning of New Year's Eve, Guo Rui's family got into trouble in the parking lot of a village in Dali, Yunnan Province.\nA young man came over and said that the license plate of Hubei A is not allowed to go out!\nGuo Rui said, we don't drive out, we just see if there is any scratch.\nThe parking lot manager came to help explain that they had lived for a long time, so it doesn't matter.\nThe young man showed suspicion and said, \"I want to report this matter to the village.\".\nMore than half a month ago, Guo Rui's parents drove from Wuhan to Dali by car.\nOn January 21st, Guo Rui took a holiday at the Science Journal Magazine, and the next day, she flew to reunite with her parents.\nAt that time, the epidemic situation in Wuhan showed signs - the unit took temperature every day and called on everyone to wear masks - but the news of “city lockdown\" was not announced until January 23.\nAccording to the original plan, their family will spend the Spring Festival in Dali.\nBack to the B&B, Guo Rui was taking a nap and vaguely heard the sound of quarreling.\nWhen she woke up, her mother told her solemnly that the young man had reported to the village director.\nThe village director came to negotiate with the owner of the B&B, saying that the car from Hubei stopped at the entrance of the village, which would make tourists and locals react violently. We don't allow you to stay here.\nGuo Rui's mother said, it’s ok to ask us to leave. There must be a normal procedure. Take our temperature at least.\"\nThe village director said that taking your temperature is a digression. Dali forbids you to stay any longer. Go to Lijiang or Xishuangbanna.\nAfter a long time, Guo Rui's father walked to the parking lot and saw the young man again. He was questioning the administrator: Why didn't you let the owner of Hubei-A go?\n\nFather was angry and said we leave right now.\nAfter returning to B&B, they started to pack up luggage.\nThe manager of B&B asked them to stay for one night, it was Chinese New Year Eve.\nFather said it’s OK. Don’t let other shout to you in the Chinese New Year Eve, there would be some troubles.\nGuo Rui's family was on the way home.\nAndy in Beijing also got into trouble because of \"Hubei-A\", and she hasn't been back to Wuhan in the past 6 months.\nOn January 27, she received a phone call from the local police station, saying that someone in the community reported and asked her to move the car.\nShe was surprised that the car was parked in the parking space, which would definitely not block anyone.\nShe was later told that the whistleblower only wanted to find out the owner of the car with license plate of Hubei-A.\nShe was very uncomfortable, and felt many pairs of eyes behind her, and her every move was being monitored.\nIn Lijiang, 55-year-old Mr. Chen and his wife came to the booked hotel, but they couldn't check in because of their Wuhan ID card starting with 4201.\nThe policeman came to mediate and asked them to go to the hospital for examination.\nAfter issuing the health certificate, the policeman said, we can't force the hotel owner to receive you. You can only find a way by yourself.\nMr. Chen found a WeChat group, which is full of Hubei people stranded in Yunnan.\nSome people in the group provide a hotel-style apartment, which costs more than RMB 200 per night to accommodate Hubei people.\nHe stayed in on January 26, and the next morning, the surrounding residents reported to the police, and the police rushed over again.\nSeals were posted outside the hotel, the cordon was pulled up, and the police stood at the door.\nAt first, they were forbidden to order takeout, and the food problem could not be solved. After a long negotiation, the police reluctantly agreed to order takeout and send it to the front desk of the hotel.\nIn Hainan Province, Wuhan accent has become the sign of plague.\nOn January 20, that is, the day when Academician Zhong Nanshan said that there was \"human-to-human infection\" with COVID-19, Chen's family in Hankou flew from Wuhan to Haikou.\nAfter leaving the airport, Xiao Chen's mother spoke to the driver in \"Mandarin which she thought was still very standard\".\nAs soon as the driver listened and said, are you from Wuhan?\nThere seem to be seriously ill there, then the driver opened the window.\nSlowly, people started to seriously talk about Wuhan.\nXiao Chen and his mother were chatting in Wuhan dialect when they took a tour bus in the West Island scenic spot of Hainan.\nSuddenly someone in the back row said angrily, \"they are all from Wuhan!\"\nThey fell silent.\nOn January 23, Wuhan was locked down, and the return flight was canceled.\nAfter several considerations, Xiao Chen decided to take his family to Changsha first, thinking that it was really impossible, so he rented a car and went back.\nAt nine o'clock in the evening of Chinese New Year Eve, they arrived at Changsha Huanghua Airport.\nBut after staying in the hotel, the front desk was empty, and the shopkeeper expelled them on the phone.\nMother was unwilling and saw a man sitting in front of the hotel next door. She asked, can we stay here?\nThe man said, you are not from Wuhan, are you?\nMy mother said in \"very nonstandard Mandarin\" that I am from Wuhan.\nThe man said, that we don't accept, hurry to leave, otherwise I will leave.\nAfter that, the man disappeared from the front desk and turned and ran upstairs.\n\n2. The message is being updated\nAt this time in Wuhan, the news of the lockdown of the city has not yet spread to every corner.\nAt 9: 00 a.m. on January 23, Zhang Ze, the express man of Wuhan University, went downstairs and saw the landlord's door closed. He said to himself, \"This grandpa used to open the door all day and asked me for water and electricity bills every day. Why is the door closed now?\"\n\nIn the snack bar, people put on masks. After eating a bowl of Regan Noodles, he took out his mobile phone and saw that the crowd was saying: Wuhan has been locked down.\nBefore going upstairs, he went to the landlord's door and looked at it again. The door was locked. He realized that something was wrong. \"The landlord ran away, he didn't even want money!\"\nAt this time, the guy from the same hometown called and said that he ran away at 8 o'clock this morning, and the time was too tight to call Zhang Ze.\nUnder various signs, Zhang Ze made a decision to go home with another fellow villager in the afternoon.\nWhen he packed his luggages, he only took 3 books with him, one of which was Foucault's “Courage to Tell the Truth”.\nWhen come to the toll station out of Wuhan, the fellow villagers who took him on the road took a video and sent a circle of friends: Come on, Wuhan!\nZhang Ze felt absurd: people are running away, but they are still encouraging Wuhan.\nOn the afternoon of New Year's Day, January 25, Wuhan COVID-19 Prevention and Control Headquarters issued an announcement: starting from 00: 00 on January 26, the central city area will be subject to motor vehicle ban management.\nSeeing that they couldn’t go back to Wuhan, Guo Rui's family, who just left Dali, planned to rush back to their hometown in Ezhou.\nParents' registered permanent residence is in Ezhou, where there is a suite. According to the infection data of epidemic situation, Ezhou was safer than Wuhan.\n一家人开始联系各自在鄂州的朋友，朋友们说还没封城，私家车应该能进来。\nThe family began to contact their friends in Ezhou, and their friends said that private cars should be able to come in before the city was locked down.\nA few hours later, they constantly received new messages: you may not be able to enter Ezhou.\nGuo Rui wanted to verify the news online. In Weibo and WeChat official account, the news she saw was like fake news. Panic made her forget to visit the government official website.\nCompared with Wuhan, which expressways are open easily, Ezhou has nowhere to find information.\nThe classmate sent her a screenshot, but she didn't understand the statement. It only said which high-speed ports can't enter Ezhou, but is Ezhou going to be locked down?\nShe suspected that mobile navigation was constantly changing with the updating of the prohibition order.\nBefore zero o’clock, they always followed the same road to Ezhou. After zero point one, the route disappeared on the map.\nAfter trying several different routes, and all failed, they had to divert to Wuhan.\nIt's past zero o’clock. Can Wuhan be opened to traffic?\nThis was also unknown.\nA few hours ago, the announcement in Wuhan was followed by another one: inform the owner of the prohibited motor vehicle 24 hours in advance by SMS, and the motor vehicle without SMS notification can pass.\nIs the person receiving the text message allowed or forbidden?\nGuo Rui read it several times then understood, her father didn't receive the text message, but he was worried that the ban would change again.\nAt 4 o'clock in the morning, they drove into Wuhan, and everything on the street was normal.\nA few hours after they got home, the friend sent a WeChat, saying that after receiving the notice, Ezhou was completely locked down from 0: 00.\nIn fact, according to the official announcement, the traffic control time for expressways and ordinary highways in Ezhou was at 14:30 on January 25.。\nBut before that, no one in the family could find a formal and clear statement, and vague news was mixed with panic, which was constantly emitted to them.\nAt 4: 00PM on the January 25, Zhou Yang, a 36-year-old Wuhan native, also received the announcement of \"No Motor Vehicles in Central City\".\nShe called the community and said that her mother had kidney disease and she had to go to the hospital for dialysis every other day.\nAt present, we have not received instructions from superiors, the community staff said.\nThe phone hung up.\nTwo hours later, the community called her back again: This happened, but now dialysis in some hospitals is lagging behind, so you have to confirm it. Are you sure you want to do dialysis the day after tomorrow?\nHow can dialysis lag behind?\nZhou Yang had not received any notice from the hospital.\nThe dialysis team's phone was busy, and so was the doctor's phone.\nIf they couldn't get dialysis, the water and toxins in her mother's body couldn't be discharged. \"The whole person is soaked in a poison tank.\".\nShe walked around the room holding her mobile phone, and the owner WeChat group was discussing community car allocation. There were 500 families in the group, one car, and the car should be reserved for patients with fever.\nMy mother couldn't walk to the hospital, she emphasized over and over again in the interview phone that afternoon.\nThe hospital is one bus-stop away from her home, but her mother's body can only support herself to walk downstairs to the vegetable market.\nAfter 4 years of dialysis, my mother lost 15 kg. When she came home after dialysis, she had to sleep for 2 hours before she could get up for lunch.\nI am ready to go against orders, Zhou Yang said. If I get caught, it’s OK.\nIn the evening, the prohibition order added the premise of \"SMS notification\", and Zhou Yang did not receive the SMS.\nEarly in the next morning, she watched the private car on the street running as fast as ever.\nOn Chinese New Year's Eve, Chen's family, who was still wandering the streets of Changsha, realized that all hotels would not take them in.\nThey turned back to the airport, thinking of at least finding a place to stay.\nAfter passing the police station near the airport, mother said, \"If it doesn’t work, we'll call the police.\"\nXiao Chen stepped forward and asked the security guard on duty at the door. We really have no place to go. Can we stay here for one night?\nThe security guard opened the small window and listened. He only said that there was no stool in it and he could not sit.\nMother was very angry. You don't even have a stool in such a big place?\nSecurity guard said, your thing, we also can't control, or there is an Internet cafe over there, you could go to the Internet cafe for one night?\nThey finally went back to the airport.\nIt was destined to be a long Chinese New Year's Eve. Xiao Chen put all his short sleeves on his body and wrapped his coat in a hurry to sleep on the stool at the airport.\nThe next day, Xiao Chen joined a WeChat group of \"Changsha Back to Wuhan\" and saw that someone had already returned to Wuhan from Changsha.\nAt this time, she realized that all the tickets on the ticketing system were gray when she bought the high-speed rail tickets from Changsha to Wuhan directly, but if she bought the tickets that stopped in Wuhan, she could still go home.\nShe immediately bought a ticket from Changsha to Lu'an, Anhui.\nWhen getting on the bus, she asked the train attendant if they could get off at Wuhan Station.\nThe train attendant didn't say anything, just asked them to register.\nThe train will arrive at Wuhan Station in an hour and a half.\nAccording to the radio, all passengers who want to get off at Wuhan Station will get off in a certain train.\nXiao Chen saw that the platform was empty and even the lights were turned off.\n2 girls waved goodbye to the conductor happily, and the conductor waved to them happily.\nXiao Chen was also relaxed and returned to Wuhan. She was no longer afraid. \"She was not liked outside.\".\n3. They were attacked by viruses and we were attacked by hostility\nAs early as the beginning of the trip, Guo Rui's family agreed to sleep at the toll station all the way instead of looking for a hotel, so as not to be expelled and rejected again.\nRoughly speaking, the journey took 24 hours, plus staying overnight. They set off at 5:00PM on January 24 and could arrive in Hubei in the early morning of January 26.\nBefore leaving, they brought quilts, instant noodles and steamed flower rolls.\nWe don't bother anyone, father said all the way.\nBut the next night, tired driving made him sleep at the toll booth for the planned time.\nFriends said before that Ezhou was locked down at 0:00, but they arrived at the border half an hour late.\nPassing a toll booth,  father asked the staff, can we enter Ezhou?\nThe staff opened their boxes and checked them, saying yes.\nFather asked where to go, and the other person answered, and followed the navigation.\nHowever, the navigation led them to a narrow dirt road, crossing a village at the junction of Wuhan and Ezhou.\nIt began to rain, and the car travelled forward, and a fuzzy outline appeared ahead, as if something was standing there.\nFather stopped the car and took a look, and when he came back, his face was very ugly: someone had set up a tombstone in the middle of the road.\n\"They are afraid that we escaped from Wuhan.\" father's voice was a little excited. \"They don't want us to pass here.\"\nFather wanted to try another way, and thought of a big road to go.\nWhen they got to the big road, their car was stopped by a policeman again.\nThey explained the cause and effect, and the policeman said, no matter what, even if you missed, the expressway is no longer open to you.\nMy father took out his ID card and said that we were originally from Ezhou. What should we do if we want to go home?\nThe policeman said, go to the hotel and wait for news. When will Ezhou stop closing the city and when will you go in?\nFather was wearing a mask, and the policeman also was wearing a mask. Father stepped forward and tried to explain again. The other party immediately said, Stay away from me.\nIn Luoyang, Henan Province, one province away, Li Yanqing, who just returned from Wuhan, received a strange phone call: \"You don't go out, you won’t harm people.\"\nHe felt puzzled, and remembered the day before, when Wuhan was locked down, the county staff called him, asked how he was and how Wuhan was doing, and collected his address, ID number and mobile phone number.\nHe also received an excel form from his classmates, which contained all the information he registered that day - for the further strange phone calls, and he decided not to answer them all.\nThe scheduled dinner for fellow villagers and friends was also canceled.\nFriends sent condolences to him, but always added a sentence at the end: \"Don't go out.\"\nLi Yanqing thought, this is always a little abandon.\nIn Maldives, Ms. Liu from Wuhan spent her 31st birthday there.\nShe and her girlfriend live in a \"water house\" for RMB 7,000 per day. The water house is built on the sea, and you can watch the sea blowing on the balcony.\nAt night, all the stars twinkle clearly above her head, and she wants to \"stay here all her life\".\n4 days later, Wuhan was locked down, and the airlines company canceled their flight back to Wuhan, so they had to move to a \"shabby hostel\" in the central city.\nAt this time, direct flights from Maldives to China could only go to Guangzhou or Shanghai.\nAfter they flew to Guangzhou, the receptionist at the hotel asked them to show their \"seven-day health certificate\".\nMrs Liu said, I have been away for 9 days.\nThe front desk said that this is the company policy, and I am also an employee.\nThey put on 3 or 4 masks and took a taxi to the hospital.\nThe receptionist heard that 2 Wuhan people were coming, and told them to stand far away, \"it must be more than 2 meters\".\nAfter the receptionist and the leader called, they said, you have to go to the fever clinic.\nClearly there is no fever, why go to fever clinic?\nMrs. Liu returned to the hotel with her friends, but failed to call 110 or change the B&B. At 9:00PM, in the lobby of the hotel, Mrs. Liu began to cry.\nHer crying finally attracted the managers from Huanggang and sent them to another hotel which is willing to accept Wuhan people.\nThe box is filled with a long bohemian dress, but the thickest one is a thin coat and cowboy trousers.\nMrs. Liu turned on the heating and stayed stuffy all night.\nWhen they got up the next day, their faces flushed bright red.\nSomeone knocked at the door, and 3 health clinic members wearing yellow protective clothing came in and swept their faces with thermometers, showing 38℃.\nThe armpit was measured again, and the temperature was normal.\nThe guard said, don't get excited, don't be nervous.\nMrs Liu wanted to change to a room with a window, but the hotel staff did not show up and put a room card at their door.\nThere is also a bottle of disinfectant attached. \"You disinfect it yourself!\"\nNo one came to clean it.\nThe 2 ladies booked a room for 3 days, but they didn't know that they would have to stay here for the next 2 months?\nAlthough the hotel is ordinary, it still costs RMB 300 per day.\nIn Hong'an, Hubei Province, Zhang Ze, the express man, finally returned to his hometown with his fellow villager's car.\nOn the 1st day of Chinese New Year, relatives called his mother to say Happy Chinese New Year, but said: Don't come to my house to greeting, especially Zhang Ze.\nHe strolled downtown, wearing a mask, but the street was empty.\nIn the evening, he sent us a WeChat:\n\"They were attacked by viruses, and when we came back from Wuhan, we were attacked by inexplicable hostility, which was too magical.\"\n4. Chinese New Year's Eve in 2020\nOn January 21, Zhou Yang got the news that the hospital where her mother was doing dialysis was going to start receiving COVID-19 patients. That night, she was insomnia until 3:00 in the morning.\nThe next morning, the mother and daughter drove to the hospital before 7 o'clock.\nStanding at the gate, mother said to her, you don't go in. You are still very young, I am old enough.\n\"I looked at my mother's back and she went in alone.\"\nSpeaking of this in the interview, Zhou Yang cried again.\nFriends didn't get together, and couldn’t go out. Li Yanqing stayed in Luoyang's hometown to quarantine himself. He played games, the king of glory, Yin and Yang master every day, and also read Chernobyl. According to him, \"It is very suitable and very hard.\"\nMore specifically, stay in his own room instead of at home.\nOn Chinese New Year's Eve, his parents walked into his room without wearing a mask.\nHe pushed them out of the door, locked the door, and shouted to the parents outside the door: \"I won't open the door if you don't wear masks.\"\nOn Chinese New Year's Eve, Li Yanqing ate a bowl of dumplings filled with pork and leek in his room.\nThis year, he also missed the link of making dumplings with his parents.\nAt one o'clock in the morning of Chinese New Year's Eve, braving the heavy snow in Yunnan, Mr. Chen drove to a hostel in the suburb of Xiangyun County.\nWhen the boss saw the health certificate he presented, he handled the check-in procedure quickly.\n2 hours later, he was woken up by the constant knock on the door - his ID card entered the system when registering at the front desk, and the arriving police asked him to get up outside the door to register information.\nAfter measuring the body temperature, the policeman stood 1 meter away from him, and looked back and said, it's better to take off the license plate of Hubei A.\nOn the 1st day of Chinese New Year, the first thing Mr. Chen did was to take off his license plate.\nHe contacted the trailer company, took the car to the 4S shop in Kunming, and then rented a car and rushed to Kunming.\n\"Am I really sick?\"\nAfter moving her luggage and getting on the bus in Yunnan, Guo Rui felt weak. Maybe it took too much effort to move things, but she thought, maybe she was really infected.\nShe looked up information on the Internet and found that infected people might not have fever. That’s why the villagers didn't take their temperature, so they decided there must be something wrong.\nWhy do we have to come to Yunnan?\nWhen she set out, she didn't know that the city would be locked down, and she didn't know that the epidemic was serious. She just wanted to reunite the whole family.\nNow, she can't help implying to herself: I am a potential virus carrier, and I am an unsafe person.\nIf I hadn't come to Yunnan, would my parents have had a Chinese New Year?\nBefore being kicked out, the village party secretary asked the owner of B&B that how many people lived here.\nThe owner said, 2 people.\nNo one dared to mention her existence.\nShe thought, I'm the one who caused everyone trouble.\nWhen the car started, father's face became more gloomy.\nOnce upon every Chinese New Year, her family was a frequent visitor to Yunnan.\nIn the early years, tourism was developed well here, father discovered Dali.\nNow Guo Rui thought that these feelings may be wishful thinking, and they were regarded as a trouble by the city.\nIf they took the initiative to find a hotel, they might be able to stay there, but father was afraid of being rejected again.\nOn the first night,  father held his breath and never spent the night in Yunnan.\nUntil 3: 00 in the morning, they arrived at the first toll station in Guizhou. The family covered with cotton-padded jackets and quilts and slept in the car for 3 hours.\nThat night is also Chinese New Year Eve. At this time in previous years, Guo Rui would receive endless New Year's greetings and red envelopes on mobile phone. There is nothing this year.\nAlmost zero o’clock, fireworks bursted into the sky.\nShe rolled down the window and looked at it. The fireworks were very loud.\n\"They base their happiness on the pain of Hubei people,\" said the father who was driving.\nMother turned her head to one side. \"I don't like Yunnan anymore.\"\nWeChat keeps pouring in on mobile phones, telling them not to come back, and the words \"don't come back\" are swiped.\nFather received a phone call from a friend: We can't explain some things clearly, but you just don't want to go back to Wuhan.\n要不我们别回了，有一回郭芮提议说，父亲如她所料地拒绝了：如果情况很糟糕，那就是给省外人添麻烦；如果没那么糟，我只想回家好好休息。\nAsked us not to go back? Once Guo Rui suggested that her father refused as she expected: if the situation is very bad, it is to trouble outsiders in the province; If it's not that bad, I just want to go home and have a good rest.\nShe knew that her father was hurt in his heart and didn't want to continue wandering outside.\nWorried about his father's fatigue driving, Guo Rui bought him a lot of refreshing chewing gum.\nAlong the way, the family played a game together: looking at the license plate in front and guessing what happened to the owner.\nSeeing a Zhejiang-A, she asked her father why Zhejiang-A was on the road. Zhejiang-A was not Hubei-A.\nFather said that Zhejiang's defense is tight, so it is estimated that people don't want to stay outside.\nAt 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, an Hubei-A came to the front, and father said, this is the same person as us, all of whom are rejected.\n*In the article, Mr. Chen, Zhang Ze, Xiao Chen, Ms. Liu and Andy are pseudonyms\nWritten by | Hong Weiling, Li Yingdi, Liu Shiyu\nEdited by｜Wu Chengjie, Kang Lukai\n\n", "English title": "Wuhan isolation: epidemic area, information isolated island and drifting of a vehicle with Wuhan plate Zhang Ze Guo Rui Wuhan", "原文標題": "武汉隔离：疫区、信息孤岛与一辆鄂A车的漂流张泽郭芮武汉_新浪网"}, {"slug": "6777", "English content": "Wuhan isolation ward care ⼠: now basically every hospitals can ⾏ nucleic acid into real\nInspection |", "English title": "Wuhan isolation ward nurse: now almost every designated hospital can carry out nucleic acid test / Personal Experience of covi", "原文標題": "武汉隔离病区护士现在基本每家定点医院都能进行核酸实验武汉肺炎亲历"}, {"slug": "6778", "English content": "", "English title": "Wuhan encourages civil servants and entrepreneurs to make friends and the internet boiling", "原文標題": "武汉鼓励公务员和企业家交朋友  网友炸锅"}, {"slug": "6779", "English content": "China / Wuhan, the new crown pneumonia officialdom major personnel adjustments or significant \"settl", "English title": "Wuhan's major official personnel adjustments may not show signs to \"settle scores at an opportune moment\"", "原文標題": "武汉官场人事大调整 或未显\"秋后算账\""}, {"slug": "6780", "English content": "Wuhan Red Cross official said \"the deployment is not timely,\" the hospital but did not get to take s", "English title": "Wuhan official said that the Red Cross Society's deployment is not timely, the hospitals can not get the donation even with relevant documents", "原文標題": "武汉官方称红会“调配不及时”， 医院拿捐赠文件却取不到物资"}, {"slug": "6781", "English content": "Wuhan, the new crown substantially revised official death toll from pneumonia, statistical standards", "English title": "Wuhan authorities have significantly revised the number of Covid-19 deaths, and the statistical criteria are still being questioned", "原文標題": "武汉官方大幅修订新冠肺炎死亡人数，统计标准仍受质疑"}, {"slug": "6782", "English content": "", "English title": "Wuhan Optical Valley mobile cabin hospital announces to be closed", "原文標題": "武汉光谷方舱医院宣布“休舱”"}, {"slug": "6784", "English content": "Wide-tumor Wuhan hospital is temporary levy Use, dictation families of cancer patients are forced to", "English title": "Family members of the cancer patients in Wuhan Guangfa Tumor Hospital who were temporarily commandeered recalled what happened to the patients after they were forced to leave the hospital", "原文標題": "武汉广发肿瘤医院被临时征用家属口述癌症患者被强制出院后的遭遇"}, {"slug": "6785", "English content": "New data through fiscal first-line Private Lesson Index Promotion Conference enterprise users to dow", "English title": "Witness the Wuhan Red Society warehouse: full of supplies, many hospitals wait for several hours but only receive a little products", "原文標題": "武汉红会仓库直击：堆满物资，多家医院等数小时领到少许"}, {"slug": "6786", "English content": "image_feature: https://i.loli.net/2020/02/04/rVuDdBAwgIbaPER.jpg\n                !

At this time, few people knew that this \"pneumonia\" was the pneumonia caused by COVID-19, which is now ravaging Hubei and spreading all over the country.\nOn January 20, Chen Luming suffered from respiratory failure. After his condition deteriorated, he entered the ICU ward and died on January 24.\nUntil his death, Chen Luming did not wait for nucleic acid test.\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients in Hubei Province have encountered many difficulties in seeking medical treatment, and nucleic acid test is one of them. Many suspected patients with COVID-19 have been unable to be diagnosed and hospitalized because they had not been arranged for nucleic acid test, and some patients had died before being diagnosed.\nAccording to “Caijing” reporters in Wuhan and other places, the difficult problem of nucleic acid test almost has run through the whole outbreak.\nThe turning point appeared on the evening of February 2. Hubei Governor Wang Xiaodong emphasized that they should do their utmost to speed up the case test, enhance the test ability of medical institutions, give play to the role of third-party testing institutions, simplify the process of filling out forms, strengthen the distribution of test samples for inspection and the quality control of testing, ensure the supply of medical materials for testing institutions, and ensure that the test stocks are digested within 2 days, and be held accountable for failing to complete the tasks.\nAlso at that night, many patients received the news through different channels.\n\"I don't know what's going on, the doctor suddenly added a list, and then I can do nucleic acid test, free of charge, and basically don't have to line up!\"\nLi Xiaoxiong, a native of Wuhan, the family suddenly got good news in Wuhan No.7 Hospital.\nAt this time, it has been more than 10 days since her mother, who is the most seriously ill, developed symptoms of infection.\nShe immediately told this news to “Caijing” reporter, hoping to spread it to more people who are waiting hard.\n\nNucleic acid test is the key to the diagnosis of suspected patients with COVID-19. If nucleic acid test is spread, it means that a large number of patients with COVID-19 symptoms will be diagnosed and further admitted to hospital.\nAt the same time, the positive signal released on February 2 was that the Wuhan epidemic prevention and control department indicated that it would concentrate on isolating and treating \"4 kinds of people\" such as suspected patients, which also brought hope to many anxious people.\nAccording to “Caijing” reporter in Wuhan, some patients were not satisfied with community work at present, some communities refused to arrange vehicles to send patients to hospitals, some hotels used for quarantine were not responsible for medical treatment, and the accommodation conditions were not ideal. Some patients could not get the latest news about testing and hospitalization in time through the community, and some false messages in the network and WeChat group made patients exhausted.\nIt is believed that centralized quarantine treatment could end the situation of \"headless flies\" and reduce the cross-infection.\nOn February 3, “Caijing” reporter learned in Wuhan that the announcement of centralized treatment by the government had just been issued, and some patients and community members said that they had not received it, and some community members expressed difficulty in the feasibility of centralized treatment, so how to implement it needed further observation.\n“Caijing” reporters will continue to pay attention to the implementation of this policy.\nFirst is the diagnosis: nucleic acid test is finally released\nAccording to official data, by 6: 20 p.m. on February 3, there were 17,335 confirmed cases, 21,558 suspected cases, 361 deaths and 503 cured cases with COVID-19, in China.\nIn Hubei, where the epidemic broke out intensively, by 6: 00AM on February 3, 11,177 cases were confirmed, 350 cases died and 295 cases were cured.\nLi Xiaoxiong was lucky.\nAt 10: 00PM on February 2, 3 members of Li Xiaoxiong's family finished nucleic acid test in Wuhan No.7 Hospital.\nFor her, the new problem was that it would take another 4 to 5 days to get the test results.\nLi Xiaoxiong's symptoms are mild, but she has vomiting and asthma symptoms. Her mother's problems had become more serious, and her lungs had become white.\nWithout the results of nucleic acid test, doctors couldn't prescribe specific drugs to cure diseases, and could only prescribe some common drugs.\nPreviously, Wuhan No.7 Hospital only opened 100 indicators for nucleic acid test every day, and only those patients who were very critical could get the doctor's prescription for nucleic acid test.\nSome patients didn't have the luck of Li Xiaoxiong. Both patient Li Yan and her husband were suspected patients. Li Yan told “Caijing” reporter on the evening of February 2 that she had just received the notice of doing nucleic acid test, but her husband who was also ill had not received it. If she was not admitted to hospital, she would have to go to the hospital for reexamination, blood collection and filming. She was worried that her husband would not survive the reexamination.\n\nYang Yang, a Wuhan native, had suspected symptoms of COVID-19. He had just finished nucleic acid test and was waiting for the results. \"It would be nice if more people were tested earlier.\"\n\nHe told “Caijing” reporter.\nYang Yang's father died of \"suspected COVID-19\" on the 4th day of Chinese New Year, and failed to be diagnosed before his death.\nOn the morning of February 2, Li Bing took  mother to the People's Hospital of Ziyang Road, Wuhan, and finally got an opportunity for nucleic acid test.\nBefore that, Li Bing accompanied mother to many hospitals. Because of the shortage of nucleic acid test kits and beds, the hospital could only prescribe drugs and asked mother to observe in quarantine.\nOn the morning of February 3, at the press conference of the State Council to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic, Tian Yulong, a member of the Party Group and chief engineer of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that there was no supply problem for nucleic acid test reagents in theory, but problems such as resumption of production had been encountered before.\nBy February 1, the daily output reached 773,000, which was 40 times of the number of suspected cases, and the production capacity was restored to 60%-70%.\nHowever, Li Bing told “Caijing” reporter that the nurse said that even if someone was diagnosed, someone could not guarantee hospitalization, and the bed was very tight, which needed to be reserved for more serious patients. Li Bing's mother had not yet had difficulty breathing.\nBut Li Bing's doctor friend told her that her mother has been very old and has been exposed to at least 3 infected people. Young people could still carry it, but older people may not be able to carry it. It was best to stay in hospital.\nLi Bing's mother has been suffering from fever, diarrhea and repeated vomiting.\nShe said that her classmate's uncle was also a suspected patient with COVID-19, and her friends have heard several cases of infection and death. She prayed that her mother could stay in hospital.\nMany patients said that they were somewhat relieved after doing nucleic acid test, and they hoped to wait to hospitalization as soon as possible.\nSome doctors and patients told “Caijing” reporter that even if the nucleic acid test showed \"negative\", it would not be safe, and there would be \"false negative\".\nA doctor said that a patient had been tested 4 times before he was found to be \"positive\". Such a situation may be caused by unqualified nucleic acid test paper, or by problems during the testing process.\nSome doctors told “Caijing” that the current testing procedure is to test negative at least twice, and ensure that the images and symptoms return to normal before the patients can go home and quarantine themselves for 2 weeks.\nSecond is traffic: Who will send patients to hospital?\nAfter the outbreak of the epidemic, from January 23, Wuhan was \"locked down\", and all the traffic in the city, such as bus and taxi, etc., was stopped.\nIn order to solve the problem of inconvenience for citizens to travel, according to Circular No.8 issued by Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Headquarters, every community in Wuhan should be equipped with 3-5 vehicles, which would be dispatched and used by community neighborhood committees.\nIn the last 2 days, “Caijing” reporters learned on the spot in Wuhan, showing that many communities have not taken up this responsibility.\nOn January 30, after repeated high fever for many days, Li Yan and her husband finally got chest X-ray CT in Wuhan Central Hospital, and the results were not optimistic. CT showed that both her and her husband had multiple patchy ground glass shadows in their lungs, which was the main symptom of this round of COVID-19.\nHusband began to have dry cough and fever many days ago. 3 days ago, Li Yan had similar symptoms. They suspected that they had been infected with COVID-19.\nAt 2 o'clock in the afternoon on January 28, she and her husband walked for an hour and came to Wuhan Central Hospital, the nearest designated hospital.\n\"We called the community and wanted to find a car to send a ride, but the community's reply was that the suspected case could not be sent, fearing to infect the driver.\"\n“Caijing” reporter called the staff in Haiyue community, Wuhan, where Li Yan lives. The staff said that the community vehicles are only used by residents without epidemic situation, and suspected patients infected with COVID-19 had special cars.\nIn order to find a car, Li Yan contacted 110, but the phone couldn't get through. Then Li Yan called 120 and emergency personnel of 120 told her that she could be cross infected if she went to hospital, so that she was hesitant. 2 days later, she had high fever, and she called 120 again and it couldn't get through.\nShe could only drag her sick body to the hospital on foot.\nAfter arriving at the hospital, she couldn't register, and she and her husband walked for another hour to go home.\nMany patients told “Caijing” reporter that there are many such cases, such as registration, waiting and seeing a doctor, which take as long as 6-8 hours. In addition, many patients are overwhelmed by walking.\nThe reporter found at the scene of the community service center that there was a steady stream of fever patients who called and asked to send a car to the hospital. On the morning of February 2, 3 batches of fever patients rushed to the community service center and asked for medical treatment.\nCommunity staff said that the drivers of the community security motorcade did not have professional protective equipment at present, and did not have the ability to transport fever patients.\nIt was necessary to wait for calling 120, and some of them had even been scheduled in 2 days. Community staff also helped to ask 110. After hearing the specific situation, 110 said that they were too busy to come.\nAccording to the reporter, at present, volunteers had undertaken a lot of work to pick up and drop off fever patients.\nSince the outbreak began, a local volunteer in Wuhan has been carrying out transportation related to the epidemic, including transporting materials, helping residents to quarantine and transfer, and assisting in sending them to hospitals.\nHe told “Caijing” reporter that many volunteers in their volunteer group were willing to take fever patients to the hospital.\nAfter sending the patients, they would disinfect the whole car and the whole body, and open the door to ventilate for half an hour by the river. \"I don't understand why the community and the government can't do this,\" the volunteer said. \"We can do it, why can't they do it?”\nOn the second day after the suspension of public transportation in Wuhan, Didi urgently set up an emergency motorcade, including community security motorcade and medical security motorcade. However, the number of drivers in the medical security motorcade was about 100, which could not meet the continuous demand for medical treatment.\nWuhan government also urgently dispatched 6,000 taxis to carry out traffic security work. However, according to the reporter's observation, there were few taxis running on Wuhan road at present, and occasionally there were a few, most of which come from the security convoys provided by Didi, Shouqi and other companies.\nThird is treatment: How many problems can centralized treatment solve?\nThe liberalization of nucleic acid test has solved the problem of patients' diagnosis to a certain extent, and another core issue that has attracted much attention is the centralized treatment of patients with different levels.\nAt noon on February 2, the epidemic prevention and control department of Wuhan issued an announcement, in order to prevent cluster infection and cross infection, all districts must complete the centralized treatment and quarantine of the existing \"4 kinds of personnel\" before 12 noon on that day, and realize the \"daily settlement\" for newly added personnel.\nThe \"4 kinds of personnel\" refer to confirmed patients, suspected patients, fever patients who cannot rule out the possibility of infection, and close contacts of confirmed patients.\nSuspected patients were no longer quarantined at home to prevent cluster infection, and the centralized treatment and quarantine places of \"4 kinds of personnel\" must be separated to prevent cross infection.\nThe policy calls for speeding up the setting up of hospitals, establishing quarantined areas and wards, requisitioning hotels, guest houses and idle factories, quickly setting up standby quarantined places and providing necessary living, disinfection and medical facilities.\nFor patients, it was really good news to implement centralized quarantine and treatment. Patients didn't have to find a car to go to the hospital like headless flies, or they could get certain treatment without reliable test and admission information.\nFor hospitals, the biggest role of centralized quarantine of the 4 kinds of people was to restore normal operation as much as possible.\nA doctor in Wuhan said on the social network that other works in many hospitals were almost in a semi-stagnant state at present, because it was impossible to distinguish whether a patient is a suspected patient, and many normal operations could no longer be carried out, but people would not suffer from other diseases because of COVID-19. If they were not rescued for a long time, the contradiction between doctors and patients would be aroused.\nFor those \"life-saving\" operations that have to be performed, only the highest level of protection was required, resulting in extremely high cost of one operation.\nThe reality was that the beds for patients in COVID-19 were still in short supply.\nA ward nurse at Liyuan Hospital, a designated hospital in Wuchang District, told “Caijing” reporter that the previous requirement was to quarantine patients, one person per ward, but due to the limited number of wards and too many patients, it has now become 2-3 patients who share one ward. \"We require patients to wear masks for 24 hours a day to minimize the possibility of cross-infection.\"\nAt the same time, there were still a large number of patients with fever pouring into the hospital every day. The nurse said that most of the patients can't be registered, and even if they were registered, they may not be hospitalized.\n\nAt present, other wards of Liyuan Hospital were undergoing renovation, and more beds would be available soon, but we had to wait.\nSome patients said that it was their hope to be admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan hospital.\nAt present, Huoshenshan Hospital, with a total construction time of only 4 days, had been delivered and would provide 1,000 beds.\nOn the morning of the February 3, the person in charge of the hospital told CCTV that the pharmacy had been equipped with various first-aid medicines, albumin, insulin, interferon, etc.\n“Caijing” reporter learned at Huoshenshan Hospital that the first batch of patients would be welcomed at Huoshenshan Hospital on the evening of February 3 at the earliest, but it would take at least 2-3 days to treat patients on a large scale.\nAnother good news that excites more patients was that from February 3, the army selected 1,400 medical personnel to undertake the medical treatment task in Wuhan Huoshenshan COVID-19 Pneumonia Specialized Hospital.\nMany medical personnel had participated in the fight against SARS in Xiaotangshan Hospital and the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia, and had rich experience in treating infectious diseases.\nAt such an extraordinary moment, the efficiency of military management and action made ordinary people feel more at ease.\nAlthough there were two specialized hospitals in Huoshenshan and Leishenshan, a doctor in Wuhan told “Caijing” reporter that it is necessary to do a good job of \"ward backup\" and continue to transform local hospitals into quarantined areas and wards, so that they could be put into use in time when the number of patients increased.\nA number of doctors also told “Caijing” reporter that some patients were mild and had self-healing ability, so they should be quarantined in a centralized way, and a small number of medical personnel should be sent to give medicine (oral medication) in a centralized way, and they should be monitored in a centralized way. Once the condition changed rapidly, they could contact the designated hospital for medical treatment immediately.\nAt present, a community worker in Wuhan told “Caijing” reporter that he had not yet received the notice of \"centralized quarantine\", and he said that even if there was such a requirement, it would be difficult to meet it.\nMany patients also said that they did not receive the notice of centralized treatment and quarantine.\n\"If we really want to concentrate on treatment and quarantine, who can meet the needs of so many residents and so much?\nWhere are there so many places to be quarantined? \"\nHe asked.\nThis community covers 14,000 residents, and the street where the community is located covers 27 communities. If people are to be concentrated and quarantined, the streets need to be arranged uniformly.\nThe above-mentioned community staff said that during the epidemic, they received various policy requirements every day, but it was very feasible, such as sending masks to residents. \"How can we send the masks that we don’t have at all?”\nIt even includes asking the other party to sign and receive when sending materials to the quarantined suspected patients. \"We must avoid contact, how can we sign?”\nIn addition, in the implementation of \"4 Concentrations\", how to ensure the daily life of medical personnel and quarantined personnel was also a challenge that needs to be actively addressed.\nSome people have appealed for launching various restaurants to make meals, ensuring catering and helping to reduce the impact of the epidemic on the catering industry; Some people suggest that the government should buy services from the society, such as catering guarantee services from Hema and Takeout, emergency travel dispatching services from Didi, and medical materials storage dispatching services from Jointow. The engineering work of emergency management should not be done by the government, and efficient dispatching is its core responsibility.\nBy 23: 00 on February 2, the utilization of beds in designated hospitals in Wuhan was: 7,332 used beds and 131 empty beds, which were still in short supply. Centralized quarantine treatment was a guarantee for patients who could not be admitted to hospital. “Caijing” reporter would continue to pay attention to how to implement this policy in Wuhan.\nPatients were helpless, the community was got wrong, and resources were still to be coordinated\nCommunity was the first link between government coordination and patients.\nThe role of community in this epidemic war was very critical.\nIn addition to arranging vehicles, the community also needed to cooperate with the government to convey epidemic prevention policies, hospital information and hotel accommodation to patients. However, some communities had not achieved satisfactory results.\n\"Now the work intensity of grassroots staff and medical staff is also very high, and patients, grassroots staff and medical staff are all under great pressure. This is the current situation in Wuhan.”\nA friend with a COVID-19 told “Caijing” reporter, \"But the news said that they asked us to contact the community immediately, if we need anything. You will find that we not only call the community, but also call various departments. There is no way to solve it.”\nShe said that because some communities did not fulfill their duty to timely transmit medical information to patients, many patients could only rely on the information on the Internet and WeChat group, for example which hospital opened new nucleic acid test and which hospital had beds, but many information were false.\nPatient Liu Jiangfei saw the news of opening beds in Tongji China-France Hospital on the Internet before. He called and repeatedly confirmed that in order to get a bed, he made an appointment for 120, and there were 360 patients in front of him. He waited from night until 6 am the next day.\nWhen I arrived at Caidian Campus of Tongji China-France Hospital, I was told that there was no bed. It was the security guard of the hospital who answered the phone and said that there was a bed.\n\"I was busy all night. I don't know how many fake news like this.\"\nHe said, \"There are so many beds on the Internet. Every day, there are news of various hospitals and various beds. Patients are squeezing their heads and want to go in. Finally, they find that it is a rumor, and it is a big blow to patients.\"\nLiu Jiangfei said that patients are either on their way to the hospital or waiting in line every day, so they can't have a good rest. Any information on the Internet may save lives, so try.\n\"What if, what if, what if you are lucky?\"\nThere are also grievances for the community.\nA few days ago, the community administrator informed Li Yan to take them to the hotel arranged by the government for the suspected patients that night, but Li Yan waited all night without news.\nThe next day, she was told that the hotel had been arranged, but there was no medical personnel, so she had to be quarantined in her own home.\n“每天一个说法，说实话我也不是很相信社区了。”\n\"New information in every day, to be honest, I don't believe in the community very much.”\nIn the face of doubts, the staff of Haiyue community where Li Yan lives responded to the “Caijing” reporter. \"The community does not specifically contact the hotel, it is the coordination of the higher authorities, and we just listen to the arrangement.”\nThe staff also reported that community work is not easy. Because of the panic caused by the epidemic, many people with common cold also came to the community to register, and the community should check them one by one.\n\"There are also some residents who said that they want to be quarantined yesterday. When the quarantine notice came down, the traffic control brigade came, and they didn't want to go.\nWe informed a resident yesterday and told him, but he changed his mind today and wanted to quarantine himself outside. \"\nCommunity staff said.\nLiu Jiangfei had pregnant women, children and the elderly at home. The quarantine conditions were not good. He called the community. The community told him that children were not easy to infect and insisted that he be quarantined at home. He asked the community staff, \"If there is infection, are you responsible for it?\"\nAfter that, the community indicated that it would try to get him to go to the hotel for quarantine.\nLiu Jiangfei's friend told “Caijing” reporter that the environment in some hotels was not ideal, and the rooms were not disinfected. When eating, all the patients were crowded together to take food, which leads to the risk of cross infection. Patients could only contact the community, but the reply from the community was that the quarantine environment is not their responsibility.\nCommunity work coordination was the chassis of the overall coordination plate in Wuhan epidemic area at present, and the optimization of community actual operation ability, responsibility and process needed to be put on the agenda.\nOn February 2, the central government held a working meeting of the leading group for dealing with pneumonia epidemic of COVID-19. The meeting held that after the outbreak, the state allocated manpower and material resources to give centralized support, but the shortage of medical resources in Hubei is still outstanding, and it is the top priority to ensure the needs of materials for prevention and control of the epidemic in Hubei Province, especially Wuhan City.\n(Chen Luming, Li Bing, Li Yan and Liu Jiangfei are pseudonyms in the article; “Caijing” reporters Han Shulin and Wang Feng also contributed to this article)\nStatement: This article is the exclusive cooperation content between “Caijing” and Tencent News, and it is declined to reprint\n\n", "English title": "Three difficulties for suspected patients in Wuhan to get to the ward", "原文標題": "武汉疑似患者通往病房的三道难关"}, {"slug": "6975", "English content": "", "English title": "11 mobile cabin hospitals in Wuhan closed", "原文標題": "武汉已有11家方舱医院休舱"}, {"slug": "6976", "English content": "Yesterday, the public anger reached its peak.

During this period, many small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed households in China had no income and continued to lose money. \nFor small and micro enterprises, this was another \"war epidemic\" of survival.\nWe could reduce the loss by 80%, if the epidemic situation was reported 2 days in advance\n\n\nOral Statement: Zhang Ji,  Owner of Restaurant, Shunyi District, Beijing      \nYesterday, several of our brothers who run restaurants made an appointment to have a drink.\nTalking about this year's situation, we were all very silent.\nIt was too difficult. Spring Festival should be the busiest time for restaurants, but now we could only keep watch over our own closed stores.\nSeveral of us were originally employees in Beijing, working as chefs in the same restaurant. After saving some money, we started our own businesses.\nOn January 19, I began to prepare dishes for the Spring Festival. More than 100 mandarin fish, more than 100 chickens and 3 truckloads of vegetables, worth RMB 150,000, were brought into the storeroom of the store.\nFrom the Chinese New Year Eve to the 6th  day, 200 tables were booked in our hotel.\nAccording to the situation in previous years, it was conservatively estimated that the daily turnover during the Spring Festival should not be less than RMB 40,000.\nAt noon of Chinese New Year Eve, I was watching TV in my office when the front desk received the first cancellation call.\nThe news channel reported that Beijing began to diagnose local COVID-19 cases one after another. My heart thumped and I had a bad feeling.\nSure enough, since noon, the contact number of the front desk had never been stopped, and over 95% of customers had canceled their reservation.\nOn the evening of Chinese New Year Eve, there were only 3 tables instead of the original 20 tables.\nAs soon as I saw that the situation was getting worse, no one dared to eat, so I took the initiative to call the rest of the customers to cancel.\nI said that the epidemic situation was serious and the store did not dare to receive it. The other party was very understanding\n\nOn the afternoon of the 1st day of Chinese New Year, I took the initiative to close the door, sent my employees home, posted a circle of friends, and gave all the dishes prepared by the kitchen to friends and regular customers in the store free of charge.\nSome people drove to my restaurant to pick them up, while others I drove to send them to others in person.\nCompared with throwing these dishes away and letting my friends eat them, I was a little more comfortable psychologically.\nOn the morning of 3rd day of Chinese New Year, I drove to the restaurant and found that our street had become a \"vegetable market\".\nThe owners of other restaurants in the same street have taken out the food which they didn't need for the Chinese New Year to set up stalls.\nChicken, duck, fish and high-grade seafood were all sold at low prices.\nI almost cried and I couldn’t bear to see more.\nI didn’t sell dishes.\nFrankly, with a loss of more than RMB 100,000 , how much can dishes be sold?\nMy staff were eager to go back home, so there was no need to leave them to accompany me to face the people coming and going on the street for thousands yuan.\nI had calculated that it was worth RMB 150,000 of foods, the monthly rent of the store is RMB 40,000, plus the salaries and utilities of employees. Since January 24, I have lost at least RMB 200,000.\nThis time, the loss of catering industry is much more serious than that during “SARS”.\nIn 2003, I worked as a chef at Longcheng Restaurant in Shunyi, Beijing.\nDuring the epidemic period, restaurants were forced to shut down for more than 2 months.\nHowever, when the epidemic occurred in April and May in that year, the restaurant warehouse would not hoard a large amount of prepared foods, but only lost the daily rent and utilities, which was less than 1/10 of the loss. Later, we spent more than 3 months to make up for the loss.\nThis year's timing is too special. Even if the news of the epidemic situation was reported  2 days in advance, we could reduce the loss by at least 80%. .\nLast year, my brother Dong Zi, who was drinking with me last night, invested RMB 3 million to open his own restaurant. Besides  RMB 1.5 million that he saved for many years, he mortgaged his house and borrowed RMB 1.5 million from the bank.\nOriginally, the restaurant had a promising future, but I didn't expect this big hit.\nDuring the Spring Festival this year, he also lost more than RMB 200,000 to hoard goods. I didn't know how long he can't open the business. He was now facing huge debt pressure.\nTheir family of 4 persons lived in Beijing, 1 child in college and the other in elementary school.\nChatting with us, he cried, I could understand his pressure, and diners were facing the same crisis.\nThese days, I stayed in the office to watch the news every day.\nI believe that with China's strength, we would be able to survive this difficult time, but it was a matter of time.\nI only hoped that the epidemic will end as soon as possible, see the dawn as soon as possible, and we can resume normal life as soon as possible.\n\nStrawberries were mature, but we couldn’t afford to picking.\n\nOral Statement: Liang Ying, Strawberry Grower, Dandong, Liaoning    \nOn the Chinese New Year Eve, at the dinner table, my brother expressed concern to his parents, and he foresaw that the Wuhan epidemic would affect the sales of strawberries at home.\nOn the 1st day of Chinese New Year, we picked a batch of strawberries from the ground and sent them to the sales outlets.\nOn the morning of the 2nd day of Chinese New Year, my brother received a phone call saying that no one was coming to deliver strawberries today. He contacted several responsible persons, and all of them said they could not accept them.\nMy hometown is in Dandong, Liaoning Province, where young adults aged between 30 and 50 have their own strawberry greenhouses.\nEvery harvest season, there were 3 or 4 trucks to collect strawberries every day, and the daily sales volume in our village was about 5,000 kg. On average, every household could earn more than RMB 20,000 per day.\nOriginally, the income during the Spring Festival accounted for 2/3 of the annual income of strawberry growers in Dandong.\nThis year, the wholesale price of strawberries near our home suddenly dropped from RMB 14 to RMB 2, and the family lost at least RMB 320,000. We hired pickers, and RMB 120 per day per person could hardly afford it.\nThe annual investment of RMB 400,000 in the 4 strawberry greenhouses in our home, together with the preparation for the harvest period from May to November, was in vain.\nStrawberries in the 2 sheds of my neighbor's uncle's grew slowly. I planned to sell the first batch of fruits with the best quality during the Spring Festival, but I didn't expect to meet the epidemic, and I lost my money.\nAs far as I know, in Dandong, at least 1/3 of growers were facing such a situation.\nIt was expected that not only Dandong strawberries, but also agricultural and sideline products in China were facing the same problem.\nOn January 28, I wrote down the unsalable situation of strawberries in my home on the Weibo.\nI have few fans in Weibo, and I usually only interacted with my classmates.\nAmazingly, I received many comments from strange accounts one after another, leaving messages expressing their wishes to buy strawberries.\nAfter discussing with my brother, I decided that instead of letting strawberries rot in the ground, it was better to sell them through the Internet.\nNetizens were too enthusiastic.\nUp to now, a total of 50 or 60 netizens have placed orders remotely, with sales of nearly RMB 10,000.\nAlthough it was very small to recover the loss of my family, I was still very grateful to them.\nSome netizens didn't receive express delivery in their areas, they specially added WeChat and told me to cheer for me.\nIt was really touching to receive the warmth from strangers. Everyone had their own lives on weekdays, but when disasters come, the distance between people becomes closer.\nAfter the loss caused by the epidemic and inspired by enthusiastic netizens, my brother realized the risk of relying too much on a single sales channel, and we would try to open up online sales channels in the future.\nThis morning, I went to the shed.\nThe villagers coming and going on the road were wearing masks and working in an orderly way.\nAlthough strawberries couldn’t be sold, everyone took good care of them as usual.\nMaybe everyone was waiting for a chance to pick the strawberries.\nI was going to pay the rent, but I didn't know when I can open yet.\n\n\nOrally Stated by Sister Cai, Owner of Japanese Restaurant, Xiushui County, Jiujiang, Jiangxi    \nI opened a Japanese restaurant in Xiushui County, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, only 300 kilometers away from Wuhan, Hubei.\nOn January 23, the day when Wuhan was locked down, my Japanese restaurant, nail shops and barber shops nearby spontaneously stopped opening.\nThe county town is too close to Wuhan, so few people ventured to walk in the streets.\nOn January 25, the Market Supervision Administration issued a notice requesting the catering units in the county to suspend business completely.\nSince closing the door, I had not earned a penny during this Spring Festival, and the cost of raw materials of RMB 4 or 5 thousand that I hoarded in the store before Spring Festival had not been recovered.\nI was going to pay the rent next month, but I didn't know when I can open yet.\nIn small county towns, the small catering industry is mostly off-season all the year round. Usually, most of them could only earn RMB 2-3 thousand per month in rent cost. We could earn enough food and clothing every month and be satisfied with our daily life.\nSpring Festival, winter and summer vacation were the peak seasons for business.\nIn previous years, from the Chinese New Year Eve to the 7th day of Chinese New Year, the average daily turnover in our store was RMB 6-7 thousand, and when it was good, we could earn RMB 1000. My friend opened a milk tea shop for more than 10 years, and the daily turnover in the store could be more than RMB 3,000.\nAfter the outbreak, he nearly collapsed.\nBefore Chinese New Year, he hoarded high-grade out-of-season fruits, such as dragon fruit, mango, kiwifruit, etc., which could not be sold, so he had to keep them and eat them slowly.\nThe day before yesterday, he came to my house to get a mask, and when he talked about business, he was oppressed in his heart.\nNatural and man-made disasters, during this period, everyone was too difficult, like those who were doing small business, who we can blame?\nWe were not like those who have fixed salaries.\nNow staying at home alone, I was worried about my future business every day.\nIt could be opened after a period of time. In the aftereffect of the pneumonia epidemic, how long would it take for the store business to improve?\nHow long did it take for the passenger flow to return to the normal level?\nIf I missed this year's Spring Festival revenue period, can my further income in this year support me to the next Spring Festival?\nIf this shop couldn't go on, maybe I could only work in a big city.\nI was not young. How could I compete with the boys and girls in their teens and early 20?\nA few days ago, I tried to communicate with the landlord, hoping that the store rent could be appropriately reduced during the period of business closure.\nShe didn't reply to me, so I thought, forget it.\nI knew that she also has a loan to pay back. In the face of this year's catastrophe, everyone had difficulties.\n\n\n“Compared with the project being stopped, the performance risk of hundreds of people was even more terrible/”\n\nOrally Stated by: Zheng Yitong,        Employee, Performance Company in Hebei Province  \nOur company mainly accepted some foreign artists to perform in China, such as concerts, song and dance dramas and so on.\nThe size of the company was small, and there were only a dozen projects a year.\nIt was originally planned to have 2 performances in March and April this year. However, in recent years, we had received notifications from various provinces and could only cancel them temporarily.\nRecently, we were busy changing schedules with actors and talking about losses with theaters every day.\nI'm almost thinking about changing jobs now\nIn fact, I had just entered the industry for 1 year, and I really liked this job, but the economic situation faced by the industry really made me have to think carefully.\nThis year, we had a project, originally scheduled to invite Italian artists to perform from the 1st day to the 7th day of Chinese New Year.\nOn Chinese New Year Eve, the actor was going to board the plane from Italy, and my colleague arrived at the Capital Airport early to pick up. As a result, he received a temporary notice from the theater saying that the performance was canceled.\nMy colleagues and I panicked and contacted all parties urgently. Fortunately, we explained the situation to each other before the actors boarded the plane.\nThe performance went bad, and when we were disappointed, we were more thankful.\nSince the Chinese New Year Eve, the epidemic has become more and more serious. Fortunately, the government stopped it in time, otherwise we couldn't really afford the performance risk of hundreds of people.\nOur original trip was from Beijing to the northeast and then to Jiangsu.\nIn case we really followed this path, we couldn't be responsible for the health and safety of foreign actors.\nThere is a friend in the industry group. More than 200 actors in the Yunnan Song and Dance Theater had worked hard to rehearse the program for more than 2 months. The original plan was to go to Shenzhen bright farm for a 20-day performance. On the first day of Chinese New Year, they were notified to cancel the performance and evacuated to Kunming urgently. The whole project suffered heavy losses.\nThe national performance market in March and April must be blank.\nAt present, we hadn't received the notice after April, so we hadn't had courage to push off the original project.\nIt was estimated that in the next half year, all the performers in the performance industry would have no job. We laughed at ourselves in the group every day, and we could only hope that the epidemic situation can be controlled as soon as possible.\nThe salary of the tourism industry had dropped to RMB 2000, and the tour guide has zero income\n\nOrally Stated by: Da Niu, Project Manager, Travel Agency in Hunan Province      \nDuring the Spring Festival this year, all travel agencies were facing losses, and thousands of employees were unemployed.\nI am in charge of some outbound travel business in a large travel agency in Hunan Province.\nOn January 24, Chinese New Year Eve, we received an urgent notice issued by the General Office of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, requesting national travel agencies and online travel enterprises to suspend the operation of team travel products.\nIt took us a whole week to return the passenger's order and negotiate with overseas airlines and hotels to cancel the contract.\nFor domestic tour, according to the requirements of relevant departments, railway, civil aviation and hotel support refund, and we would also refund all the expenses to passengers.\nOverseas travel products involve different countries and policies, and the situation is complicated.\nGenerally speaking, overseas airlines and hotels will not refund money to travel agencies because of China's special circumstances.\nAccording to Article 67 of the “Tourism Law”, some losses that have already occurred, such as airfare and hotel expenses, needed to be borne by passengers together with us.\nAfter this ordeal, there was a loss of RMB millions.\nThe basic salary of tourism industry was implemented according to the minimum wage standard of every city, and its performance accounted for a large part.\nDuring the Spring Festival this year, the monthly income of more than 1,000 employees in our travel agency was only RMB 2,000, and more than 100 tour guides in the front line were in a state of zero income.\nThe industrial chain of tourism is very long, in which the capital flow in one ring is interrupted, and the whole line will be interrupted.\nNot only the employees of our travel agencies, but also the hotels, scenic spots, aviation, motorcades and service industries have low thresholds and many jobs, and some practitioners will lose their jobs, resulting in serious economic losses.\nIt is conservatively estimated that we may not start business normally until July and August.\nTourism is an industry that relies heavily on the state of the national economy. Only when people have enough food and clothing and spare funds will they consider traveling and having fun.\nThis time, the recovery period of tourism will only be longer than that of other industries.\nSome colleagues joked that no one hopes world peace and good weather more than the tourism industry.\nI joined the industry in 2008 and have been in business for 12 years, which is the biggest setback for the tourism industry since I joined the industry.\nCompared with the SARS period, today's tourism industry has expanded by 1 or 2 times, with more employees and a larger number of unemployed people. Many small and medium-sized private travel agencies may not survive this level.\nMany friends around me were considering changing jobs and posts.\nIn the first half of this year, tour guides must have lost their jobs, and many of them are still facing the pressure of car loans and mortgage loans. Some friends have started to find ways to find jobs in factories in Shenzhen, or consider going to overseas enterprises to make a living.\nThere is a saying that HR declares unemployment in other industries, while CCTV news directly declares our unemployment in tourists.\nI hope that after the epidemic, the state can introduce relevant policies to support and guide the rehabilitation of tourism, and help front-line tour guides survive.\nI know a tour guide leader of Thailand. He and his colleagues spontaneously raised funds to buy 80 boxes of medical masks. On January 30, they personally shipped the materials back to China from Thailand and sent them directly to Wuhan at the airport.\nWhile future was still uncertain, we were still concerned about the epidemic areas and tried our best to help Wuhan people tide over the difficulties.\nI am very proud of being a member of the tourism industry.\n\n* At the request of the interviewee, some of the article are pseudonyms.\n\nWritten by | Yao Yuan\nEdited by | Cui Yumin\nComposed by | Zeng Xin\n", "English title": "The loss of small and micro enterprises is much more serious than that of SARS", "原文標題": "小微企业的损失，比非典那次严重得多"}, {"slug": "7169", "English content": "Wuhan closed city, home snacks are gone, anyway idle is idle, biscuits bake a ha ha ha ha", "English title": "Xiao Yang Ma Ma's Broadcast", "原文標題": "小样麻麻的广播"}, {"slug": "7170", "English content": "Most of the night was awakened rumbling sound, especially her husband calm, aircraft ah, Bang for se", "English title": "Xiao Yang Ma Ma's Broadcast", "原文標題": "小样麻麻的广播"}, {"slug": "7171", "English content": "Why is there so much pushed supermarkets, ah, this is our family already half out of first purchase ", "English title": "Xiao Yang Ma Ma's Broadcast", "原文標題": "小样麻麻的广播"}, {"slug": "7172", "English content": "Like a dream every day, morning colleagues uncle gone, removed to the various hospitals are unable t", "English title": "Xiao Yang Ma Ma's Broadcast", "原文標題": "小样麻麻的广播"}, {"slug": "7173", "English content": "", "English title": "Xiao Yang Ma Ma's Broadcast", "原文標題": "小样麻麻的广播"}, {"slug": "7174", "English content": "", "English title": "Xiao Yang Ma Ma's Broadcast", "原文標題": "小样麻麻的广播"}, {"slug": "7175", "English content": "Family to spend time together dawdle, very good ......", "English title": "Xiao Yang Ma Ma's Broadcast", "原文標題": "小样麻麻的广播"}, {"slug": "7176", "English content": "1.

Observer Network  Reporter  Chen Yueqing\nOn the afternoon of February 10, Liang, a 70-year-old suspected COVID-19 patient, jumped to his death in Guangdian Jiangwan New Town Community, Qiaokou District, Wuhan City.\nLiang Xin, a son of Liang, told the Economic Observer Network that his father jumped from the balcony of his home on the 9th floor at 14: 57 on February 10 and died on the spot.\nAbout 20 minutes later, 110, 120 and forensic doctors arrived at the scene.\nAfter forensic identification, Liang's death was not homicide.\nLiang Xin revealed that because both parents were suspected to be infected with COVID-19, he did not live with his parents, and was quarantined from his home in Hanyang District, taking care of 2 children.\nWhen his father jumped off the building, only his mother was present, leaving only one sentence to his mother, \"I don't want to bring trouble to you\", and then he turned down with his hands on the railing.\n\nPatient with severe uremia\nLiang Xin told Economic Observer Network that his father has been suffering from uremia for 5 years and has been undergoing dialysis treatment in Zhongshan Hospital in Qiaokou District.\nOn January 27, Liang had fever when he was undergoing dialysis in Zhongshan Hospital, Hubei Province. He suspected that he might be infected by surrounding patients during the hospital treatment, so he had an examination in the hospital fever clinic.\nThe CT results showed that Liang's lungs had patchy blur, infection or a little pulmonary edema, hardening of aorta and coronary artery, and atrophy of both kidneys.\nThe doctor of Zhongshan Hospital told Liang Xin that because his father was suspected to be infected with COVID-19, the hospital no longer gave him dialysis and suggested going to Pu'ai Hospital.\n6 days later, after many twists and turns, father had a dialysis in Pu'ai Hospital, but was told that he had to be diagnosed as COVID-19 before he could continue treatment in Pu'ai Hospital.\nBecause the community has been unable to arrange nucleic acid test, this became the last dialysis for father.\nBy February 10, father died, and father, who needed dialysis 3 times a week, had not had dialysis for 8 days.\n\"My father is a patient with severe uremia. If he can't do dialysis in time, the water in his body can't be discharged.\"\nLiang Xin said that his father had been unable to eat for 7 days, with diarrhea and dying.\n\"There is no problem for ordinary patients to be quarantined at home for 1-2 weeks, but severe uremia is not an ordinary patient. If you can't do dialysis, you will die!\"\nAfter Liang Xin reported his father's illness to the community and street, and hoped to deal with it urgently, but the response was, \"Suspected cases can only be quarantined at home\" and \"in the process\".\nLiang Xin repeatedly called the mayor's hotline, and the staff told him that his father's situation had been accepted, so please wait patiently.\n\nDidn't get the opportunity to receive nucleic acid testing\nOn February 9, the day before Liang jumped off the building, the community informed Liang Xin's brother to take his father to Gutian Street Health Service Station for nucleic acid testing.\nWhen they arrived, the community worker said that the doctor who had tested had been off work and would come back at 8:30 tomorrow morning.\nOn February 10, Liang Xin's father and mother waited at the entrance of Gutian Street Community Service Station 15 minutes earlier. \"My dad was quite happy at that time.\".\nAt the appointed 9:30, no staff was seen at the scene. Liang Xin called the community staff to inquire about the situation. The other party said that the community had already arranged it, but suddenly found that there was no throat swab and no doctor to do the test, so that they could continue to wait at Gutian Street Community Service Station.\n\"My dad haven’t eaten for a week, and he was restless in the community service station, and incontinence was happening.\"\nKnowing that the 2 old people couldn't wait in the community, Liang Xin called again to ask the community for urgent treatment, and the community said that they could take the number first and go home.\nBy about 3:00 pm, Liang still couldn't wait for the news that the community could arrange nucleic acid test.\nAt 9: 00 pm on February 10, Liang's body was transported away by special car.\nAn hour later, his wife, who was also suspected with COVID-19, was admitted to Puren Hospital.\nLiang Xin denied that it was \"in order to exchange his wife's hope for a dead end\" that Liang had jumped from the building.\nHe told Economic Observer Network that his father was in a critical condition with uremia. He just didn't want to drag down his family, and then he died in despair.\nXu Ting (a pseudonym), a property officer in the community, told the reporter that \"no hospital is willing to accept the elderly have uremia and need dialysis.\nOn the other hand, because the beds in hospitals are tight, it has not been possible to arrange nucleic acid testing and send a car to send the elderly to the hospital, which leads to the elderly dying. “\nThis article has been certified as \"original\" and is written by Economic Observer.
